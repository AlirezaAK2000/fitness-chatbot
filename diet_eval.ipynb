    "- Dietary preference: Reflects the plan (e.g., \"Vegetarian\", \"Paleo\", \"Low-carb\", \"Balanced macro\").\n",
    "- Query: A natural language query that this persona might ask when registering, based on the plan (e.g., \"I want a high-protein vegetarian plan under 1500 calories\", \"I need a paleo intermittent fasting plan around 2400 calories\", \"I’m looking for a weight loss plan under 100g carbs per day\").\n",

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\\n\\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\\n\\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\\n\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\\n\\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\\n\\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\\n\\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\\n\\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss.

The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\\n\\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\\n\\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\\n\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\\n\\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\\n\\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\\n\\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\\n\\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\\n\\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\\n\\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\\n\\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

It was designed to increase intake of foods expected to lower blood pressure while being heart healthy and meeting Institute of Medicine (IOM) nutrient recommendations. It is available at specific calorie levels. It was adapted from the dietary pattern developed for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) research trials. In the trials, the DASH dietary pattern lowered blood pressure and LDL- cholesterol levels, resulting in reduced cardiovascular disease risk. The DASH Eating Plan is low in saturated fats and rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as fiber and protein. It also is lower in sodium than the typical American diet,\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 90\\n\\nand includes menus with two levels of sodium, 2,300 and 1,500 mg per day.

In diabetes, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin (a hormone that helps glucose, the body’s main source of fuel, get into cells), or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced, which causes too much glucose to be released in the blood. The three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. If not controlled, diabetes can lead to serious complications.\\n\\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)—A set of nutrient-based reference values that are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy people.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Spaghetti Sauce\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nMeatballs\\n\\n3 medium meatballs\\n\\nParmesan Cheese\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\\n\\nContributes: Saturated Fats\\n\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nApple, Raw ½ medium\\n\\nWater, Tap 1 cup\\n\\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\\n\\nCucumber\\n\\n1 cup\\n\\n3 slices\\n\\nAvocado\\n\\n¼ cup, cubed\\n\\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\\n\\n3 tablespoons, shredded\\n\\nRanch Salad Dressing\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\n761 Calories\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\\n\\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box).

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n2,200\\n\\n2,400\\n\\n2,600\\n\\n2,800\\n\\n3,000\\n\\n3,200\\n\\nFood Group[b]\\n\\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n7½\\n\\n7½\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)[d]\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2\\n\\n3½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n3 oz-eq\\n\\n4 oz-eq\\n\\n5 oz-eq 5½ oz-eq 6½ oz-eq 6½ oz-eq 7½ oz-eq 8½ oz-eq 9½ oz-eq 10½ oz-eq 10½ oz-eq 10½ oz-eq\\n\\nWhole Grains[e] (oz-eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n2,200\\n\\n2,400\\n\\n2,600\\n\\n2,800\\n\\n3,000\\n\\n3,200\\n\\nFood Group[b]\\n\\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n7½\\n\\n7½\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2\\n\\n3½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n3 oz-eq\\n\\n4 oz-eq\\n\\n5 oz-eq\\n\\n5 oz-eq\\n\\n6 oz-eq\\n\\n6 oz-eq\\n\\n7 oz-eq\\n\\n8 oz-eq\\n\\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\\n\\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\nRefined Grains (oz-eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 84\\n\\nTable A4-1.

All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n2,200\\n\\n2,400\\n\\n2,600\\n\\n2,800\\n\\n3,000\\n\\n3,200\\n\\nFood Group[b]\\n\\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\n4 c-eq\\n\\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n7½\\n\\n7½\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n2\\n\\n3½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1 c-eq\\n\\n1½ c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2 c-eq\\n\\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\n3 c-eq\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n3 oz-eq\\n\\n4 oz-eq\\n\\n5 oz-eq\\n\\n5 oz-eq\\n\\n6 oz-eq\\n\\n6 oz-eq\\n\\n7 oz-eq\\n\\n8 oz-eq\\n\\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\\n\\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\nRefined Grains (oz-eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 84\\n\\nTable A4-1.

At the same time, rates of chronic diseases—many of which are related to poor quality diet and physical inactivity—have increased. About half of all American adults have one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\\n\\nHowever, a large body of evidence now shows that healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of the lifespan. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects this evidence through its recommendations.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is required under the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, which states that every 5 years, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture (USDA) must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. The statute (Public Law 101-445, 7 U.S.C. 5341 et seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be\\n\\nbased on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. The 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds from the 2010 edition with revisions based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of Federal agency and public comments.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet. The information in the Dietary Guidelines is used in developing Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of HHS and USDA food programs. It is developed for use by policymakers and nutrition and health professionals. Additional audiences who may use Dietary Guidelines information to develop programs, policies, and communication for the general public include businesses, schools, community groups, media, the food industry, and State and local governments.\\n\\nPrevious editions of the Dietary Guidelines focused primarily on individual dietary components such as food groups and nutrients. However, people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the\\n\\ndiet forms an overall eating pattern. The components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health. These patterns can be tailored to an individual’s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices. These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget. Several examples of healthy eating patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Summary\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\n2\\n\\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\\n\\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\\n\\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Food Groupa\\n\\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n2½ c-eq/day\\n\\nDark Green\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nRed & Orange\\n\\n5½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nStarchy\\n\\n5 c-eq/wk\\n\\nOther\\n\\n4 c-eq/wk\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n2 c-eq/day\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n6 oz-eq/day\\n\\nWhole Grains\\n\\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nRefined Grains\\n\\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nDairy\\n\\n3 c-eq/day\\n\\nProtein Foods\\n\\n5½ oz-eq/day\\n\\nSeafood\\n\\n8 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\\n\\n26 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\\n\\n5 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nOils\\n\\n27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\\n\\n270 kcal/day (14%)\\n\\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\\n\\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\\n\\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\\n\\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\\n\\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\\n\\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\\n\\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6.

Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\\n\\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\\n\\nHOME\\n\\nMeal Planning', '[18] Cooked, edible portion\\n\\n[19] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint guidance regarding seafood consumption for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children. For more information, see the FDA and EPA websites www.FDA.gov/fishadvice; www.EPA.gov/fishadvice.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 24\\n\\nAbout Meats & Poultry\\n\\nMeat, also known as red meat, includes all forms of beef, pork, lamb, veal, goat, and non- bird game (e.g., venison, bison, and elk). Poultry includes all forms of chicken, turkey, duck, geese, guineas, and game birds (e.g., quail and pheasant). Meats and poultry vary in fat content and include both fresh and processed forms. Lean meats and poultry contain less than 10 g of fat, 4.5 g or less of saturated fats, and less than 95 mg of cholesterol per 100 g and per labeled serving size (e.g., 95% lean ground beef, pork tenderloin, and skinless chicken or turkey breast). Processed meats and processed poultry (e.g., sausages, luncheon meats, bacon, and beef jerky) are products preserved by smoking, curing, salting, and/or the addition of chemical preservatives.\\n\\nStrong evidence from mostly prospective cohort studies but also randomized controlled trials has shown that eating patterns that include lower intake of meats as well as processed meats and processed poultry are associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults. Moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults. As described earlier, eating patterns consist of multiple, interacting food components, and the relationships to health exist for the overall eating pattern, not necessarily to an isolated aspect of the diet. Much of this research on eating patterns has grouped together all meats and poultry, regardless of fat content or processing, though some evidence has identified lean meats and lean poultry in healthy eating patterns. In separate analyses, food pattern modeling has demonstrated that lean meats and lean poultry can contribute important nutrients within limits for sodium, calories from saturated fats and added sugars, and total calories when consumed in recommended amounts in healthy eating patterns, such as the Healthy U.S.-Style and Mediterranean-Style Eating Patterns.\\n\\nThe recommendation for the meats, poultry, and eggs subgroup in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 26 ounce-equivalents per week. This is the same as the amount that was in the primary USDA Food Patterns of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. As discussed in Chapter 2, average intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs for teen boys and adult men are above recommendations in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern. For those who eat animal products, the recommendation for the protein foods subgroup of meats, poultry, and eggs can be met by consuming a variety of lean meats, lean poultry, and eggs. Choices within these eating patterns may include processed meats and processed poultry as long as the resulting eating pattern is within limits for sodium, calories from saturated fats and added sugars, and total calories.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fifth Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Lettuce & Celery\\n\\nApples & Grapes\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nWhole-Grain Bread\\n\\nFat-Free Milk\\n\\nChicken Breast & Unsalted Walnuts\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nOils\\n\\nMayonnaise\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Introduction — Page xv\\n\\nFigure ES-1.

Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\n2\\n\\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\\n\\nvital to health.

Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content=\"# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 2600 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): ~180 g\\n- Carbs (average per day): ~220 g\\n- Fat (average per day): ~80 g\\n- Fiber (average per day): 30 g\\n- Notes: This plan emphasizes lean meats, vegetables, and healthy fats, with controlled carbohydrate and fat intake.

When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.

Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box).

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\\n\\nFocus on whole fruits.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nMake half your grains whole grains.\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\\n\\nVary your veggies.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nVary your protein routine.\\n\\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\\n\\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\\n\\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\\n\\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\\n\\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\\n\\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\\n\\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\\n\\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\\n\\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce.

Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\\n\\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\\n\\nHOME\\n\\nMeal Planning', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', '1 to 3\\n\\n4 to 8\\n\\n9 to 13\\n\\n14 to 18\\n\\n19 to 30\\n\\n31 to 50\\n\\n51 to 70\\n\\n71 +\\n\\n1 to 3\\n\\n4 to 8\\n\\n9 to 13\\n\\n14 to 18\\n\\n19 to 30\\n\\n31 to 50\\n\\n51 to 70\\n\\n71 +\\n\\nMales (years)\\n\\nFemales (years)\\n\\nDATA SOURCES: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2007-2010 for average intakes by age-sex group.

Shifts are needed within the protein foods group to increase seafood intake, but the foods to be replaced depend on the individual’s current intake from the other protein subgroups. Strategies to increase the variety of protein foods include incorporating seafood as the protein foods choice in meals twice per week in place of meat, poultry, or eggs, and using legumes or nuts and seeds in mixed dishes instead of some meat or poultry. For example, choosing a salmon steak, a tuna sandwich, bean chili, or almonds on a main-dish salad could all increase protein variety.\\n\\nShifting to nutrient-dense options, including lean and lower sodium options, will improve the nutritional quality of protein food choices and support healthy eating patterns. Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods (see Figure 2-3) by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 2,500 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): 160g\\n- Carbs (average per day): 300g\\n- Fat (average per day): 80g\\n- Fiber (average per day): 30g\\n- Notes: Designed to support muscle maintenance and active lifestyle with a high-protein, balanced intake of carbs and healthy fats.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'Summary\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\n2\\n\\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\\n\\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\\n\\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Appendix 13.

It was designed to increase intake of foods expected to lower blood pressure while being heart healthy and meeting Institute of Medicine (IOM) nutrient recommendations. It is available at specific calorie levels. It was adapted from the dietary pattern developed for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) research trials. In the trials, the DASH dietary pattern lowered blood pressure and LDL- cholesterol levels, resulting in reduced cardiovascular disease risk. The DASH Eating Plan is low in saturated fats and rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as fiber and protein. It also is lower in sodium than the typical American diet,\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 90\\n\\nand includes menus with two levels of sodium, 2,300 and 1,500 mg per day. It meets the Dietary Reference Intakes for all essential nutrients and stays within limits for overconsumed nutrients, while allowing adaptable food choices based on food preferences, cost, and availability.\\n\\nDiabetes—A disorder of metabolism— the way the body uses digested food (specifically carbohydrate) for growth and energy. In diabetes, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin (a hormone that helps glucose, the body’s main source of fuel, get into cells), or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced, which causes too much glucose to be released in the blood. The three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. If not controlled, diabetes can lead to serious complications.\\n\\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)—A set of nutrient-based reference values that are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy people. DRIs expand on the periodic reports called Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), which were first published by the Institute of Medicine in 1941.\\n\\nAcceptable Macronutrient\\n\\nDistribution Ranges (AMDR)— Range of intake for a particular energy source (i.e., carbohydrate, fat, and protein) that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing intakes of essential nutrients. If an individual’s intake is outside of the AMDR, there is a potential of increasing the risk of chronic diseases and/or insufficient intakes of essential nutrients.\\n\\nAdequate Intakes (AI)—A\\n\\nrecommended average daily nutrient intake level based on observed or experimentally determined\\n\\nPage 91 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\napproximations or estimates of mean nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people. An AI is used when the Recommended Dietary Allowance cannot be determined.\\n\\nEstimated Average Requirements\\n\\n(EAR)—The average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)—The average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nTolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)—The highest average daily nutrient intake level likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for nearly all individuals in a particular life stage and sex group. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse health effects increases.

The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\\n\\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2).

To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss.

Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 950 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): 70-80g\\n- Carbs (average per day): 50-70g\\n- Fat (average per day): 45-55g\\n- Fiber (average per day): 10-15g\\n- Notes: This plan is designed to be high in protein and low in carbs, suitable for supporting muscle maintenance and fat loss.

Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'www.fitness.gov\\n\\nwww.pyfp.org/index.shtml\\n\\nwww.presidentschallenge.org\\n\\nwww.adultfitnesstest.org\\n\\nwww.cdc.gov/healthyschools/physicalactivity/guidelines.htm\\n\\nwww.cdc.gov/bam\\n\\nProgram/Initiative\\n\\nLead Office\\n\\nWebsite\\n\\nWe Can!

Estimated Calorie Needs per Day, by Age, Sex, & Physical Activity Level\\n\\nThe total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity. In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain calorie balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) equations, using reference heights\\n\\n(average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For children and adolescents, reference height and weight vary. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.\\n\\nEstimates range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for adult men. Within each age and sex category, the low end of the range is for sedentary individuals; the high end of the range is for active individuals. Due to reductions\\n\\nin basal metabolic rate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age. Estimated needs for young children range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories per day, and the range for older children and adolescents varies substantially from 1,400 to 3,200 calories per day, with boys generally having higher calorie needs than girls. These are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be aided with online tools such as those available at www.supertracker.usda.gov.\\n\\nTable A2-1.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Food Groupa\\n\\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n2½ c-eq/day\\n\\nDark Green\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nRed & Orange\\n\\n5½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nStarchy\\n\\n5 c-eq/wk\\n\\nOther\\n\\n4 c-eq/wk\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n2 c-eq/day\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n6 oz-eq/day\\n\\nWhole Grains\\n\\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nRefined Grains\\n\\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nDairy\\n\\n3 c-eq/day\\n\\nProtein Foods\\n\\n5½ oz-eq/day\\n\\nSeafood\\n\\n8 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\\n\\n26 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\\n\\n5 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nOils\\n\\n27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\\n\\n270 kcal/day (14%)\\n\\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\\n\\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\\n\\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\\n\\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\\n\\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM.

Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\\n\\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Key Recommendations:\\n\\nConsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\\n\\nA healthy eating pattern includes:[1]\\n\\nA variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy,\\n\\nand other\\n\\nFruits, especially whole fruits\\n\\nGrains, at least half of which are whole grains\\n\\nFat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\\n\\nA variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,\\n\\nseeds, and soy products\\n\\nOils', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6.

Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.

Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'Food Groupa\\n\\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n2½ c-eq/day\\n\\nDark Green\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nRed & Orange\\n\\n5½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nStarchy\\n\\n5 c-eq/wk\\n\\nOther\\n\\n4 c-eq/wk\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n2 c-eq/day\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n6 oz-eq/day\\n\\nWhole Grains\\n\\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nRefined Grains\\n\\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nDairy\\n\\n3 c-eq/day\\n\\nProtein Foods\\n\\n5½ oz-eq/day\\n\\nSeafood\\n\\n8 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\\n\\n26 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\\n\\n5 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nOils\\n\\n27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\\n\\n270 kcal/day (14%)\\n\\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\\n\\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

It was designed to increase intake of foods expected to lower blood pressure while being heart healthy and meeting Institute of Medicine (IOM) nutrient recommendations. It is available at specific calorie levels. It was adapted from the dietary pattern developed for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) research trials. In the trials, the DASH dietary pattern lowered blood pressure and LDL- cholesterol levels, resulting in reduced cardiovascular disease risk. The DASH Eating Plan is low in saturated fats and rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as fiber and protein. It also is lower in sodium than the typical American diet,\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 90\\n\\nand includes menus with two levels of sodium, 2,300 and 1,500 mg per day. It meets the Dietary Reference Intakes for all essential nutrients and stays within limits for overconsumed nutrients, while allowing adaptable food choices based on food preferences, cost, and availability.\\n\\nDiabetes—A disorder of metabolism— the way the body uses digested food (specifically carbohydrate) for growth and energy. In diabetes, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin (a hormone that helps glucose, the body’s main source of fuel, get into cells), or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced, which causes too much glucose to be released in the blood. The three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. If not controlled, diabetes can lead to serious complications.\\n\\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)—A set of nutrient-based reference values that are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy people. DRIs expand on the periodic reports called Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), which were first published by the Institute of Medicine in 1941.\\n\\nAcceptable Macronutrient\\n\\nDistribution Ranges (AMDR)— Range of intake for a particular energy source (i.e., carbohydrate, fat, and protein) that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing intakes of essential nutrients. If an individual’s intake is outside of the AMDR, there is a potential of increasing the risk of chronic diseases and/or insufficient intakes of essential nutrients.\\n\\nAdequate Intakes (AI)—A\\n\\nrecommended average daily nutrient intake level based on observed or experimentally determined\\n\\nPage 91 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\napproximations or estimates of mean nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people. An AI is used when the Recommended Dietary Allowance cannot be determined.\\n\\nEstimated Average Requirements\\n\\n(EAR)—The average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)—The average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nTolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)—The highest average daily nutrient intake level likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for nearly all individuals in a particular life stage and sex group. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse health effects increases. E\\n\\nEating Behaviors—Individual behaviors that affect food and beverage choices and intake patterns, such as what, where, when, why, and how much people eat.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\\n\\nFocus on whole fruits.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nMake half your grains whole grains.\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\\n\\nVary your veggies.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nVary your protein routine.\\n\\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\\n\\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\\n\\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\\n\\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Over the past century, deficiencies\\n\\nof essential nutrients have dramatically decreased, many infectious diseases have been conquered, and the majority of the U.S. population can now anticipate a long and productive life. At the same time, rates of chronic diseases—many of which are related to poor quality diet and physical inactivity—have increased. About half of all American adults have one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\\n\\nHowever, a large body of evidence now shows that healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of the lifespan. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects this evidence through its recommendations.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is required under the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, which states that every 5 years, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture (USDA) must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. The statute (Public Law 101-445, 7 U.S.C. 5341 et seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be\\n\\nbased on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. The 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds from the 2010 edition with revisions based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of Federal agency and public comments.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet. The information in the Dietary Guidelines is used in developing Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of HHS and USDA food programs. It is developed for use by policymakers and nutrition and health professionals. Additional audiences who may use Dietary Guidelines information to develop programs, policies, and communication for the general public include businesses, schools, community groups, media, the food industry, and State and local governments.\\n\\nPrevious editions of the Dietary Guidelines focused primarily on individual dietary components such as food groups and nutrients. However, people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the\\n\\ndiet forms an overall eating pattern. The components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health. These patterns can be tailored to an individual’s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices. These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget. Several examples of healthy eating patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fifth Guideline:\\n\\n1.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6.

See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\\n\\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\\n\\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\\n\\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\\n\\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\\n\\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\\n\\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent.

The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\\n\\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\\n\\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\\n\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\\n\\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\\n\\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\\n\\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\\n\\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\\n\\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\\n\\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\\n\\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

It was designed to increase intake of foods expected to lower blood pressure while being heart healthy and meeting Institute of Medicine (IOM) nutrient recommendations. It is available at specific calorie levels. It was adapted from the dietary pattern developed for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) research trials. In the trials, the DASH dietary pattern lowered blood pressure and LDL- cholesterol levels, resulting in reduced cardiovascular disease risk. The DASH Eating Plan is low in saturated fats and rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as fiber and protein. It also is lower in sodium than the typical American diet,\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 90\\n\\nand includes menus with two levels of sodium, 2,300 and 1,500 mg per day. It meets the Dietary Reference Intakes for all essential nutrients and stays within limits for overconsumed nutrients, while allowing adaptable food choices based on food preferences, cost, and availability.\\n\\nDiabetes—A disorder of metabolism— the way the body uses digested food (specifically carbohydrate) for growth and energy. In diabetes, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin (a hormone that helps glucose, the body’s main source of fuel, get into cells), or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced, which causes too much glucose to be released in the blood. The three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. If not controlled, diabetes can lead to serious complications.\\n\\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)—A set of nutrient-based reference values that are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy people. DRIs expand on the periodic reports called Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), which were first published by the Institute of Medicine in 1941.\\n\\nAcceptable Macronutrient\\n\\nDistribution Ranges (AMDR)— Range of intake for a particular energy source (i.e., carbohydrate, fat, and protein) that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing intakes of essential nutrients. If an individual’s intake is outside of the AMDR, there is a potential of increasing the risk of chronic diseases and/or insufficient intakes of essential nutrients.\\n\\nAdequate Intakes (AI)—A\\n\\nrecommended average daily nutrient intake level based on observed or experimentally determined\\n\\nPage 91 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\napproximations or estimates of mean nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people. An AI is used when the Recommended Dietary Allowance cannot be determined.\\n\\nEstimated Average Requirements\\n\\n(EAR)—The average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)—The average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex group.\\n\\nTolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)—The highest average daily nutrient intake level likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for nearly all individuals in a particular life stage and sex group. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse health effects increases. E\\n\\nEating Behaviors—Individual behaviors that affect food and beverage choices and intake patterns, such as what, where, when, why, and how much people eat.', 'Over the past century, deficiencies\\n\\nof essential nutrients have dramatically decreased, many infectious diseases have been conquered, and the majority of the U.S. population can now anticipate a long and productive life. At the same time, rates of chronic diseases—many of which are related to poor quality diet and physical inactivity—have increased. About half of all American adults have one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\\n\\nHowever, a large body of evidence now shows that healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of the lifespan. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects this evidence through its recommendations.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is required under the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, which states that every 5 years, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture (USDA) must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. The statute (Public Law 101-445, 7 U.S.C. 5341 et seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be\\n\\nbased on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. The 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds from the 2010 edition with revisions based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of Federal agency and public comments.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet. The information in the Dietary Guidelines is used in developing Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of HHS and USDA food programs. It is developed for use by policymakers and nutrition and health professionals. Additional audiences who may use Dietary Guidelines information to develop programs, policies, and communication for the general public include businesses, schools, community groups, media, the food industry, and State and local governments.\\n\\nPrevious editions of the Dietary Guidelines focused primarily on individual dietary components such as food groups and nutrients. However, people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the\\n\\ndiet forms an overall eating pattern. The components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health. These patterns can be tailored to an individual’s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices. These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget. Several examples of healthy eating patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): ~1450 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): ~110g\\n- Carbs (average per day): ~60g\\n- Fat (average per day): ~85g\\n- Fiber (average per day): ~20g\\n- Notes: This low-carb, high-protein plan is designed for weight loss and muscle maintenance.

The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\\n\\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\\n\\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\\n\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\\n\\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\\n\\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\\n\\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\\n\\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\\n\\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\\n\\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\\n\\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Appendix 13.

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Over the past century, deficiencies\\n\\nof essential nutrients have dramatically decreased, many infectious diseases have been conquered, and the majority of the U.S. population can now anticipate a long and productive life. At the same time, rates of chronic diseases—many of which are related to poor quality diet and physical inactivity—have increased. About half of all American adults have one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\\n\\nHowever, a large body of evidence now shows that healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of the lifespan. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects this evidence through its recommendations.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is required under the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, which states that every 5 years, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture (USDA) must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. The statute (Public Law 101-445, 7 U.S.C. 5341 et seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be\\n\\nbased on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. The 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds from the 2010 edition with revisions based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of Federal agency and public comments.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet. The information in the Dietary Guidelines is used in developing Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of HHS and USDA food programs. It is developed for use by policymakers and nutrition and health professionals. Additional audiences who may use Dietary Guidelines information to develop programs, policies, and communication for the general public include businesses, schools, community groups, media, the food industry, and State and local governments.\\n\\nPrevious editions of the Dietary Guidelines focused primarily on individual dietary components such as food groups and nutrients. However, people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the\\n\\ndiet forms an overall eating pattern. The components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health. These patterns can be tailored to an individual’s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices. These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget. Several examples of healthy eating patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided.', 'Summary\\n\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\n2\\n\\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\\n\\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\\n\\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\\n\\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6', 'Appendix 5.

A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a primary emphasis of the recommendations in this 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines. This edition of the Dietary Guidelines consists of this Introduction, three chapters, and 14 appendixes:\\n\\nChapter 1. Key Elements of\\n\\nHealthy Eating Patterns discusses the relationship of diet and physical activity to health over the lifespan and explains the principles of a healthy eating pattern. The chapter provides quantitative recommendations for a Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level as an example to show how individuals can follow these principles and recommendations. It also includes two variations at the same 2,000-calorie level as examples of other healthy eating patterns individuals can choose based on personal preference: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Chapter 1 focuses on the first three Guidelines and the Key Recommendations.\\n\\nChapter 2. Shifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns compares current food and nutrient intakes in the United States to recommendations and describes the shifts in dietary choices that are needed to align current intakes with recommendations. Chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Guideline.\\n\\nChapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in\\n\\nSupporting Healthy Eating Patterns explains how all individuals and segments of society in the\\n\\nUnited States have an important role to play in supporting healthy eating and physical activity choices. It outlines a variety of strategies and actions that align with the Dietary Guidelines. Chapter 3 focuses on the fifth Guideline.\\n\\nThe Appendixes provide additional\\n\\ninformation to support the content of the chapters, including recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans; calorie needs by age, sex, and level\\n\\nof physical activity; the base Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern; two other examples of healthy eating patterns: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Eating Patterns; a glossary of terms; and nutritional goals for various age-sex groups. The Appendixes also include a list of selected Government resources on diet and physical activity; additional information on alcohol; lists of food sources of nutrients of public health concern; and food safety principles and guidance.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content=\"# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 2,400–2,600\\n- Protein (average per day): 100–120g\\n- Carbs (average per day): 350–400g\\n- Fat (average per day): 70–90g\\n- Fiber (average per day): 30–35g\\n- Notes: This plan is structured to support your vegetarian diet and intermittent fasting routine, focusing on high-protein plant-based proteins, dairy, and nutrient-dense foods, within a 16/8 fasting window (eating between 10 am and 6 pm).\\n\\n# Daily Meal Tables\\n\\n## Day 1 (Monday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|------------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Breakfast | Greek yogurt (1 cup), chia seeds (1 tbsp), mixed berries (1/2 cup), honey (1 tsp) | 350 | 20g | 45g | 8g |\\n| Lunch | Quinoa (1 cup cooked), chickpeas (1/2 cup), mixed vegetables (bell peppers, spinach), olive oil (1 tbsp), feta cheese (1 oz) | 650 | 25g | 85g | 20g |\\n| Snack | Celery sticks with almond butter (2 tbsp) | 200 | 6g | 10g | 18g |\\n| Dinner | Lentil curry (1.5 cups cooked lentils), brown rice (1 cup cooked), steamed broccoli | 700 | 35g | 100g | 8g |\\n| Optional Snack | Cottage cheese (1/2 cup) with a few walnuts | 200 | 14g | 8g | 10g |\\n\\n## Day 2 (Tuesday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Breakfast | Oatmeal (1 cup oats), protein powder (vanilla, 1 scoop), flaxseed (1 tbsp), sliced banana | 400 | 25g | 65g | 8g |\\n| Lunch | Veggie burger (plant-based patty), whole-wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, avocado (1/4), sweet potato fries (baked) | 700 | 30g | 90g | 20g |\\n| Snack | Greek yogurt (1/2 cup) with sliced almonds | 150 | 10g | 10g | 8g |\\n| Dinner | Stir-fried tofu (150g) with mixed vegetables and soba noodles, sesame oil | 750 | 35g | 80g | 20g |\\n| Optional Snack | A small handful of trail mix (nuts & seeds) | 150 | 5g | 10g | 10g |\\n\\n*(Same format for Days 3-7 with varied high-protein vegetarian meals.)*\\n\\n## Day 3 (Wednesday)\\n*(Sample high-protein vegetarian meal plan, focus on eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based proteins.)*\\n\\n## Day 4 (Thursday)\\n\\n## Day 5 (Friday)\\n\\n## Day 6 (Saturday)\\n\\n## Day 7 (Sunday)\\n\\n*(Ensure each day varies with different plant proteins like tempeh, beans, lentils, nut butters, dairy, eggs, and fortified plant milks.)*\\n\\n# Grocery List\\n- Proteins:\\n  - Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, tofu, tempeh, plant-based protein powders, chickpeas, lentils, black beans, walnuts, almonds, trail mix\\n- Carbs & Grains:\\n  - Quinoa, oats, brown rice, soba noodles, whole-wheat bread or buns, sweet potatoes, whole-grain cereals\\n- Vegetables & Fruits:\\n  - Berries, bananas, spinach, bell peppers, broccoli, avocado, tomatoes, mixed vegetables, celery\\n- Others:\\n  - Olive oil, sesame oil, honey, flaxseed, chia seeds, almonds, walnuts\\n\\n# Recipes\\n\\n## Recipe 1: Lentil Curry\\n- Ingredients:\\n  - 1.5 cups cooked lentils\\n  - 1 tbsp olive oil\\n  - 1 onion, diced\\n  - 2 garlic cloves minced\\n  - 1 can diced tomatoes\\n  - Spices: turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika\\n  - Vegetables (carrots, spinach)\\n- Instructions:\\n  1.

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nA Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern (Appendix 5) replaces the previous Lacto\\xad ovo Vegetarian Adaptation of the USDA Food Patterns from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. The Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern was developed taking into account food choices of self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and provides recommendations to meet the Dietary Guidelines for those who follow a vegetarian pattern.\\n\\nIn comparison to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern includes more legumes (beans and peas), soy products, nuts and seeds, and whole grains. It contains no meats, poultry, or seafood, and is identical to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern in amounts of all other food groups. The Pattern is similar in meeting\\n\\nnutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, but is somewhat higher in calcium and dietary fiber and lower in vitamin D, due to differences in the foods included in the protein foods group, specifically more tofu and beans and no seafood, as shown in Appendix 5.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\\n\\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\\n\\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\\n\\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\\n\\nTable A5-1.

Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\\n\\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\\n\\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\\n\\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\\n\\nTable A5-1.

The Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern was developed taking into account food choices of self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and provides recommendations to meet the Dietary Guidelines for those who follow a vegetarian pattern.\\n\\nIn comparison to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern includes more legumes (beans and peas), soy products, nuts and seeds, and whole grains. It contains no meats, poultry, or seafood, and is identical to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern in amounts of all other food groups. The Pattern is similar in meeting\\n\\nnutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, but is somewhat higher in calcium and dietary fiber and lower in vitamin D, due to differences in the foods included in the protein foods group, specifically more tofu and beans and no seafood, as shown in Appendix 5.', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 1000 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): ~70g\\n- Carbs (average per day): ~50g\\n- Fat (average per day): ~50g\\n- Fiber (average per day): ~15g\\n- Notes: This low-carb, high-protein vegetarian plan focuses on plant-based proteins like legumes, tofu, seitan, and dairy, with minimal grains and starchy vegetables to keep carbs low.

USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\\n\\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\\n\\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\\n\\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\\n\\nTable A5-1. Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About Legumes (Beans & Peas)\\n\\nLegumes include kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, garbanzo beans (chickpeas), lima beans (mature, dried), split peas, lentils, and edamame (green soybeans).\\n\\nLegumes are excellent sources of protein. In addition, they provide other nutrients that also are found in seafood, meats, and poultry, such as iron and zinc. They are excellent sources of dietary fiber and of nutrients, such as potassium and folate that also are found in other vegetables.\\n\\nBecause legumes have a similar nutrient profile to foods in both the protein foods group and the vegetable group, they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food and thus, can be counted as a vegetable or a protein food to meet recommended intakes.\\n\\nGreen peas and green (string) beans are not counted in the legume subgroup, because their nutrient compositions are not similar to legumes. Green peas are similar to starchy vegetables and are grouped with them. Green beans are grouped with the other vegetables subgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce, celery, and cabbage, because their nutrient content is not similar to legumes.\\n\\nand orange vegetables the most vitamin A, legumes the most dietary fiber, and starchy vegetables the most potassium. Vegetables in the “other” vegetable subgroup provide a wide range of nutrients in varying amounts.\\n\\nConsiderations: To provide all of the nutrients and potential health benefits that vary across different types of vegetables, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for each subgroup. Vegetable choices over time should vary and include many different vegetables. Vegetables should be consumed in a nutrient-dense form, with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy sauces. When selecting frozen or canned vegetables, choose those lower in sodium.\\n\\nand 100% fruit juice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. The recommended amount of fruits in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2 cup-equivalents per day. One cup of 100% fruit juice counts as 1 cup of fruit. Although fruit juice can be part of healthy eating patterns, it is lower than whole fruit in dietary fiber and when consumed in excess can contribute extra calories. Therefore, at least half of the recommended amount of fruits should come from whole fruits. When juices are consumed, they should be 100% juice, without added sugars. Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options that are lowest in added sugars. One-half cup of dried fruit counts as one cup-equivalent of fruit. Similar to juice, when consumed in excess, dried fruits can contribute extra calories.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 1400 kcal  \\n- Protein (average per day): 60-70g  \\n- Carbs (average per day): 180-200g  \\n- Fat (average per day): 40-50g  \\n- Fiber (average per day): 25-30g  \\n- Notes:  \\n  - This plan is designed for vegetarian intermittent fasting, with a window from 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM.  \\n  - Focuses on plant-based proteins like legumes, tofu, and seeds.  \\n  - Includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds.  \\n  - Simple, accessible ingredients with options for substitutions.  \\n\\n# Daily Meal Tables\\n\\n## Day 1 (Monday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Quinoa (½ cup cooked), Chickpeas (½ cup), Mixed greens, Cucumber, Cherry tomatoes, Olive oil (1 tsp), Lemon juice | 450 | 15g | 65g | 12g |\\n| Snack | Handful of almonds (14g), Orange (1 medium) | 200 | 6g | 24g | 11g |\\n| Dinner | Tofu (¾ cup), Steamed broccoli, Brown rice (½ cup), Sesame seeds (1 tsp), Soy sauce | 550 | 22g | 70g | 16g |\\n\\n## Day 2 (Tuesday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Lentil soup (1 bowl), Whole-grain bread (1 slice), Mixed greens | 440 | 18g | 60g | 8g |\\n| Snack | Chia pudding (2 tbsp chia seeds soaked in almond milk), Berries | 200 | 8g | 25g | 8g |\\n| Dinner | Tempeh (¾ cup), Roasted sweet potatoes, Green beans, Olive oil (1 tsp) | 560 | 25g | 70g | 14g |\\n\\n## Day 3 (Wednesday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Black bean salad (½ cup beans), Cilantro, Lime, Corn, Avocado (¼), Whole wheat tortilla | 470 | 17g | 65g | 14g |\\n| Snack | Walnuts (14g), Apple | 200 | 4g | 27g | 13g |\\n| Dinner | Stir-fried tempeh, Mixed vegetables (bell peppers, carrots), Quinoa (½ cup), Sesame oil (1 tsp) | 530 | 24g | 65g | 16g |\\n\\n## Day 4 (Thursday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Hummus (3 tbsp), Whole-grain pita, Sliced cucumber, Cherry tomatoes, Feta cheese (optional) | 450 | 15g | 60g | 12g |\\n| Snack | Pumpkin seeds (14g), Peach | 200 | 8g | 20g | 9g |\\n| Dinner | Baked eggplant with tomato basil sauce, Lentils (½ cup), Brown rice (½ cup) | 550 | 20g | 70g | 14g |\\n\\n## Day 5 (Friday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Quinoa salad with black beans, Corn, Bell peppers, Avocado, Olive oil | 460 | 17g | 65g | 14g |\\n| Snack | Cashews (14g), Orange | 200 | 5g | 24g | 11g |\\n| Dinner | Stir-fried tofu, Mixed vegetables, Brown rice, Sesame seeds | 540 | 22g | 65g | 15g |\\n\\n## Day 6 (Saturday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Chickpea and vegetable curry, Whole grain naan or bread | 450 | 15g | 70g | 10g |\\n| Snack | Sunflower seeds (14g), Berries | 200 | 6g | 22g | 11g |\\n| Dinner | Lentil and vegetable stir-fry, Quinoa (½ cup), Olive oil (1 tsp) | 550 | 20g | 66g | 14g |\\n\\n## Day 7 (Sunday)\\n| Meal | Ingredients | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |\\n|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------|-----|\\n| Lunch | Tofu scramble with veggies, Whole grain toast, Fruit salad | 460 | 18g | 60g | 12g |\\n| Snack | Mixed nuts (14g), Pear | 200 | 5g | 27g | 11g |\\n| Dinner | Vegetable and bean chili, Brown rice (½ cup), Avocado slices | 540 | 20g | 65g | 15g |\\n\\n# Grocery List\\n- Proteins:\\n  - Chickpeas, Lentils, Black beans, Tempeh, Tofu, Eggs, Nuts & Seeds (almonds, walnuts, pumpkin, sunflower)\\n- Carbs & Grains:\\n  - Quinoa, Brown rice, Whole grain bread, Whole wheat tortillas, Oats\\n- Vegetables & Fruits:\\n  - Mixed greens, Cucumbers, Cherry tomatoes, Bell peppers, Carrots, Broccoli, Sweet potatoes, Green beans, Eggplant, Berries, Oranges, Apples, Peaches, Pears\\n- Others:\\n  - Olive oil, Sesame seeds, Chia seeds, Hummus, Feta cheese (optional), Soy sauce, Lime, Basil, Spices\\n\\n# Recipes\\n\\n## Recipe 1: Quinoa & Chickpea Salad\\n- Ingredients: Cooked quinoa, canned chickpeas (rinsed), chopped cucumber, cherry tomatoes, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, herbs (parsley or cilantro)\\n- Instructions:\\n  1.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', '[5] For more information on this action, see Appendix 14.

A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a primary emphasis of the recommendations in this 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines. This edition of the Dietary Guidelines consists of this Introduction, three chapters, and 14 appendixes:\\n\\nChapter 1. Key Elements of\\n\\nHealthy Eating Patterns discusses the relationship of diet and physical activity to health over the lifespan and explains the principles of a healthy eating pattern. The chapter provides quantitative recommendations for a Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level as an example to show how individuals can follow these principles and recommendations. It also includes two variations at the same 2,000-calorie level as examples of other healthy eating patterns individuals can choose based on personal preference: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Chapter 1 focuses on the first three Guidelines and the Key Recommendations.\\n\\nChapter 2. Shifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns compares current food and nutrient intakes in the United States to recommendations and describes the shifts in dietary choices that are needed to align current intakes with recommendations. Chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Guideline.\\n\\nChapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in\\n\\nSupporting Healthy Eating Patterns explains how all individuals and segments of society in the\\n\\nUnited States have an important role to play in supporting healthy eating and physical activity choices. It outlines a variety of strategies and actions that align with the Dietary Guidelines. Chapter 3 focuses on the fifth Guideline.\\n\\nThe Appendixes provide additional\\n\\ninformation to support the content of the chapters, including recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans; calorie needs by age, sex, and level\\n\\nof physical activity; the base Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern; two other examples of healthy eating patterns: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Eating Patterns; a glossary of terms; and nutritional goals for various age-sex groups. The Appendixes also include a list of selected Government resources on diet and physical activity; additional information on alcohol; lists of food sources of nutrients of public health concern; and food safety principles and guidance.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\\n\\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\\n\\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\n\\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\\n\\nFigure 2-6.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\\n\\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\\n\\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\\n\\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\\n\\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\\n\\nTable A5-1. Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', '[5] For more information on this action, see Appendix 14.

A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a primary emphasis of the recommendations in this 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines. This edition of the Dietary Guidelines consists of this Introduction, three chapters, and 14 appendixes:\\n\\nChapter 1. Key Elements of\\n\\nHealthy Eating Patterns discusses the relationship of diet and physical activity to health over the lifespan and explains the principles of a healthy eating pattern. The chapter provides quantitative recommendations for a Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level as an example to show how individuals can follow these principles and recommendations. It also includes two variations at the same 2,000-calorie level as examples of other healthy eating patterns individuals can choose based on personal preference: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Chapter 1 focuses on the first three Guidelines and the Key Recommendations.\\n\\nChapter 2. Shifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns compares current food and nutrient intakes in the United States to recommendations and describes the shifts in dietary choices that are needed to align current intakes with recommendations. Chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Guideline.\\n\\nChapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in\\n\\nSupporting Healthy Eating Patterns explains how all individuals and segments of society in the\\n\\nUnited States have an important role to play in supporting healthy eating and physical activity choices. It outlines a variety of strategies and actions that align with the Dietary Guidelines.

(continued...) Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Appendix 13.

Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', '2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page xi\\n\\nThe Guidelines\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.

All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Spaghetti Sauce\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nMeatballs\\n\\n3 medium meatballs\\n\\nParmesan Cheese\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\\n\\nContributes: Saturated Fats\\n\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nApple, Raw ½ medium\\n\\nWater, Tap 1 cup\\n\\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\\n\\nCucumber\\n\\n1 cup\\n\\n3 slices\\n\\nAvocado\\n\\n¼ cup, cubed\\n\\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\\n\\n3 tablespoons, shredded\\n\\nRanch Salad Dressing\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\n761 Calories\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\\n\\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6', '27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)\\n\\n[e]\\n\\n260 kcal/day (13%)\\n\\n290 kcal/day (15%)\\n\\n[a] Food group amounts shown in cup- (c) or ounce- (oz) equivalents (eq).

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\\n\\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\\n\\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\\n\\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\\n\\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\\n\\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\\n\\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\\n\\nFocus on whole fruits.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nMake half your grains whole grains.\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\\n\\nVary your veggies.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nVary your protein routine.\\n\\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\\n\\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\\n\\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\\n\\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Spaghetti Sauce\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nMeatballs\\n\\n3 medium meatballs\\n\\nParmesan Cheese\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\\n\\nContributes: Saturated Fats\\n\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nApple, Raw ½ medium\\n\\nWater, Tap 1 cup\\n\\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\\n\\nCucumber\\n\\n1 cup\\n\\n3 slices\\n\\nAvocado\\n\\n¼ cup, cubed\\n\\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\\n\\n¼ cup\\n\\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\\n\\n3 tablespoons, shredded\\n\\nRanch Salad Dressing\\n\\n1 tablespoon\\n\\n761 Calories\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\\n\\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories', '27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)\\n\\n[e]\\n\\n260 kcal/day (13%)\\n\\n290 kcal/day (15%)\\n\\n[a] Food group amounts shown in cup- (c) or ounce- (oz) equivalents (eq).

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'Food Groupa\\n\\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n2½ c-eq/day\\n\\nDark Green\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nRed & Orange\\n\\n5½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\\n\\n1½ c-eq/wk\\n\\nStarchy\\n\\n5 c-eq/wk\\n\\nOther\\n\\n4 c-eq/wk\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n2 c-eq/day\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n6 oz-eq/day\\n\\nWhole Grains\\n\\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nRefined Grains\\n\\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\\n\\nDairy\\n\\n3 c-eq/day\\n\\nProtein Foods\\n\\n5½ oz-eq/day\\n\\nSeafood\\n\\n8 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\\n\\n26 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\\n\\n5 oz-eq/wk\\n\\nOils\\n\\n27 g/day\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\\n\\n270 kcal/day (14%)\\n\\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\\n\\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6.

Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\\n\\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'About This Chapter\\n\\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\\n\\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\\n\\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\\n\\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\\n\\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='# Meal Plan Overview\\n- Calories (average per day): 1900 kcal\\n- Protein (average per day): ~140g\\n- Carbs (average per day): ~100g\\n- Fat (average per day): ~110g\\n- Fiber (average per day): ~30g\\n- Notes: This plan is based on Paleo principles with Intermittent Fasting (16:8 schedule, fasting from 8 PM to 12 PM).

Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\\n\\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\\n\\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\\n\\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\\n\\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\\n\\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\\n\\nChild 1-3\\n\\nFemale 4-8\\n\\nMale 4-8\\n\\nFemale 9-13\\n\\nMale 9-13\\n\\nFemale 14-18\\n\\nMale 14-18\\n\\nFemale 19-30\\n\\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400, 1,600\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nProtein, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\n19\\n\\n19\\n\\n34\\n\\n34\\n\\n46\\n\\n52\\n\\n46\\n\\nProtein, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n5-20\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-30\\n\\n10-35\\n\\nCarbohydrate, g\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\n130\\n\\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n45-65\\n\\nDietary Fiber, g\\n\\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\\n\\n14\\n\\n16.8\\n\\n19.6\\n\\n22.4\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n25.2\\n\\n30.8\\n\\n28\\n\\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nTotal Fat, % kcal\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n30-40\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n25-35\\n\\n20-35\\n\\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\\n\\nDGA\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n<10%\\n\\nLinoleic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n11\\n\\n16\\n\\n12\\n\\nLinolenic Acid, g\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\\n\\nMale 19-30\\n\\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\\n\\n56\\n\\n10-35\\n\\n130\\n\\n45-65\\n\\n33.6\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n20-35\\n\\n<10%\\n\\n17\\n\\n1.6', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\\n\\nFocus on whole fruits.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nMake half your grains whole grains.\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\\n\\nVary your veggies.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nVary your protein routine.\\n\\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\\n\\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\\n\\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\\n\\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

Meals are concentrated in an 8-hour window (e.g., 12:00 pm to 8:00 pm), with no breakfast, just lunch, dinner, and optional snacks. Carbs come mainly from vegetables and fruits to stay Paleo. Protein is prioritized to support active lifestyle and muscle maintenance. Healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil help energy requirements. Meals are varied to ensure micronutrient diversity and flavor.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Daily Meal Tables\\n\\n## Day 1 (Monday)\\n| Meal           | Ingredients
