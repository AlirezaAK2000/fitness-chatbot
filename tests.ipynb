       "  AIMessage(content=\"Here is a personalized workout plan designed to help you achieve your weight loss goals, tailored to your moderate activity level. This plan focuses on a full-body approach, combining strength and cardiovascular elements to maximize calorie burn and build lean muscle.\\n\\nLet's get you started, John!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Your Personalized Weight Loss Workout Plan**\\n\\n**Goal:** Weight Loss\\n**Focus:** Full-body strength, cardiovascular endurance, and calorie expenditure.\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n*   Aim to perform this workout 3-4 times per week, with at least one rest day in between sessions.\\n*   Listen to your body. If an exercise causes pain, stop immediately.\\n*   Focus on proper form over speed or number of reps.\\n*   Stay hydrated throughout your workout.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Phase 1: Warm-up (8-10 minutes)**\\nThis phase prepares your muscles and joints for the workout, increasing blood flow and reducing the risk of injury.\\n\\n1.  **Jumping Jacks**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with feet together, arms at your sides. Jump, spreading your feet wide and bringing your arms overhead. Jump back to the starting position.\\n    *   **Duration:** 60 seconds\\n    *   **Benefits:** Increases heart rate, warms up the entire body, and improves coordination.\\n\\n2.  **Arm Circles (Forward & Backward)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall with arms extended out to the sides. Make small, controlled circles forward for 30 seconds, then switch to backward circles for 30 seconds. Gradually increase the size of the circles.\\n    *   **Duration:** 60 seconds (30s forward, 30s backward)\\n    *   **Benefits:** Warms up shoulders, rotator cuffs, and upper back.\\n\\n3.  **Dynamic Leg Swings (Forward & Side)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Hold onto a wall or sturdy object for balance. Swing one leg forward and backward in a controlled motion for 30 seconds. Then, swing the same leg side-to-side for 30 seconds. Switch legs and repeat.\\n    *   **Duration:** 2 minutes (30s each direction per leg)\\n    *   **Benefits:** Improves hip mobility, warms up hamstrings, quads, and hip flexors.\\n\\n4.  **Torso Twists**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and arms bent at your sides. Gently twist your torso from side to side, allowing your arms to swing naturally.\\n    *   **Duration:** 60 seconds\\n    *   **Benefits:** Warms up the spine and core muscles, improving rotational flexibility.\\n\\n5.  **Walking Lunges**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should be directly above your ankle, and your back knee should hover just above the ground. Push off your back foot to bring it forward and step into the next lunge.\\n    *   **Duration:** 60 seconds (approx. 10-12 lunges per leg)\\n    *   **Benefits:** Activates leg muscles (quads, hamstrings, glutes) and improves balance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Phase 2: Main Workout (30-40 minutes)**\\nThis circuit-style workout maximizes calorie burn by keeping your heart rate elevated and engaging multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Perform each exercise in the circuit back-to-back with minimal rest (15-30 seconds). Once you complete one full round of all exercises, rest for 60-90 seconds before starting the next round.\\n\\n**Complete 3-4 Rounds of the following circuit:**\\n\\n1.  **Bodyweight Squats**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly out. Keep your chest up and core engaged. Lower your hips as if sitting into a chair, ensuring your knees track in line with your toes. Go as deep as comfortable while maintaining good form. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.\\n    *   **Reps:** 12-15 repetitions\\n    *   **Benefits:** Strengthens glutes, quads, hamstrings, and improves hip mobility. A foundational exercise for overall lower body strength and calorie expenditure.\\n\\n2.  **Push-ups (Knees or Toes)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Start in a plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels (or knees if on your knees). Lower your chest towards the floor by bending your elbows.
