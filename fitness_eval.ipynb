If something hurts, stop and reassess your form.\\n*   **Focus on Form Over Weight:** Especially when starting, prioritize performing each exercise with correct technique. This will prevent injury and ensure you're effectively targeting the right muscles.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To continue building muscle and strength, you'll need to gradually challenge your muscles. This means slowly increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time as you get stronger.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Showing up for your workouts regularly is more important than having a perfect session every time.\\n*   **Nutrition & Rest:** Remember that muscle growth happens outside the gym. Ensure you're eating enough protein to support muscle repair and growth, and get adequate sleep (7-9 hours) for recovery.\\n\\nYou've got this, John!

This means slowly increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time as you get stronger.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Showing up for your workouts regularly is more important than having a perfect session every time.\\n*   **Nutrition & Rest:** Remember that muscle growth happens outside the gym. Ensure you're eating enough protein to support muscle repair and growth, and get adequate sleep (7-9 hours) for recovery.\\n\\nYou've got this, John! This plan provides a solid foundation for your goals. Stay consistent, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger.

Use your other hand to gently push down on the elbow, deepening the stretch. Repeat on the other side.\\n5.  **Child's Pose (Back/Hips):** Kneel on the floor, sit your hips back towards your heels, and extend your arms forward on the floor. Rest your forehead on the mat.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Tips for Beginners:\\n\\n*   **Focus on Form:** This is the most crucial aspect, especially when starting. Watch videos, use mirrors, and don't be afraid to ask gym staff for a quick demonstration. Perfecting form prevents injury and ensures you're targeting the right muscles.\\n*   **Start Light:** It's better to use a lighter weight and perform the exercise correctly than to use a heavy weight with poor form. You can always increase the weight as you get stronger.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Some muscle soreness (DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) is normal when you start, but sharp pain is not. If something hurts, stop.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to your 3 days a week. Showing up consistently is more important than having a perfect workout every time.\\n*   **Nutrition & Hydration:** Support your muscle growth by eating a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Rest & Recovery:** Your muscles grow when you rest, not when you're working out. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\\n\\nYou've got this, John! This plan will set you on a great path to building muscle and gaining strength. Enjoy the process and celebrate your progress!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-7b1c2c04-2478-472e-9346-d58203efd1a6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 571, 'output_tokens': 2249, 'total_tokens': 3919, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})} \n",

Focus on controlled movements and proper form over lifting heavy weight.\\n\\n**General Guidelines:**\\n*   **Sets & Reps:** Perform 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions for each exercise.\\n*   **Rest:** Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets to allow for partial recovery.\\n*   **Weight Selection:** Choose a weight that allows you to complete all reps with good form, but where the last 1-2 reps feel challenging. If you can do more than 12 reps easily, increase the weight slightly next time. If you can't complete 10 reps with good form, decrease the weight.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**1. Leg Press (Machine)**\\n    *   **Target Muscles:** Quadriceps (front of thighs), Hamstrings (back of thighs), Glutes (buttocks).\\n    *   **Instructions:**\\n        1.  Sit on the leg press machine with your back flat against the pad. Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring your knees are aligned with your ankles.\\n        2.  Release the safety catches.\\n        3.  Slowly lower the platform by bending your knees until they are at about a 90-degree angle. Do not let your lower back lift off the pad.\\n        4.  Push the platform back up to the starting position using your heels and the balls of your feet, but do not lock out your knees at the top. Keep a slight bend.\\n        5.  Control the movement both on the way down and up.\\n    *   **Benefits:** A great compound exercise for building lower body strength and muscle mass, with good support for beginners.\\n\\n**2. Machine Chest Press**\\n    *   **Target Muscles:** Pectoralis Major (chest), Anterior Deltoids (front of shoulders), Triceps (back of upper arms).\\n    *   **Instructions:**\\n        1.  Adjust the seat so the handles are aligned with the middle of your chest when you sit down.\\n        2.  Sit with your back firmly against the pad, feet flat on the floor. Grip the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.\\n        3.  Exhale as you push the handles forward until your arms are almost fully extended, but do not lock your elbows.\\n        4.  Inhale as you slowly return the handles to the starting position, feeling a stretch in your chest.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Effectively targets the chest muscles and is safer for beginners than free-weight bench presses, allowing focus on the pressing motion.\\n\\n**3. Lat Pulldown (Machine)**\\n    *   **Target Muscles:** Latissimus Dorsi (lats, large back muscles), Biceps (front of upper arms).\\n    *   **Instructions:**\\n        1.

Sit down, leaning back slightly (about 10-15 degrees).\\n        3.  Exhale as you pull the bar down towards your upper chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Focus on pulling with your back muscles, not just your arms.\\n        4.  Inhale as you slowly allow the bar to return to the starting position, controlling the weight as your arms extend fully.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Builds strength and width in the back, crucial for good posture and overall upper body balance.\\n\\n**4. Machine Shoulder Press**\\n    *   **Target Muscles:** Deltoids (shoulders), Triceps (back of upper arms).\\n    *   **Instructions:**\\n        1.  Adjust the seat so the handles are at shoulder height. Sit with your back firmly against the pad, feet flat on the floor. Grip the handles with an overhand grip.\\n        2.  Exhale as you press the handles upwards until your arms are almost fully extended overhead, but do not lock your elbows.\\n        3.

Your elbows should be directly under your shoulders, and your body should form a straight line from head to heels.\\n        2.  Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine. Keep your glutes squeezed and avoid letting your hips sag or pike up.\\n        3.  Hold this position for as long as you can maintain good form.\\n    *   **Sets & Duration:** 3 sets, hold for 20-30 seconds (or as long as possible with good form).\\n    *   **Benefits:** Excellent for building foundational core strength and stability, which is vital for all other exercises and daily activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (5-7 minutes)\\n\\nThe cool-down helps your heart rate return to normal and static stretching improves flexibility and aids in muscle recovery. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply.\\n\\n1.  **Quad Stretch:** Stand tall, grab your right ankle with your right hand, and gently pull your heel towards your glutes. Keep your knees together. Feel the stretch in the front of your thigh. Repeat on the left side.\\n2.  **Hamstring Stretch:** Sit on the floor with one leg extended straight out. Bend the other leg, placing the sole of your foot against your inner thigh. Lean forward from your hips, reaching towards your toes on the extended leg. Repeat on the other side.\\n3.  **Chest Stretch:** Stand in a doorway or near a wall. Place your forearm on the doorframe/wall with your elbow bent at 90 degrees.

Repeat on the other side.\\n5.  **Child's Pose (Back/Hips):** Kneel on the floor, sit your hips back towards your heels, and extend your arms forward on the floor. Rest your forehead on the mat.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Tips for Beginners:\\n\\n*   **Focus on Form:** This is the most crucial aspect, especially when starting. Watch videos, use mirrors, and don't be afraid to ask gym staff for a quick demonstration. Perfecting form prevents injury and ensures you're targeting the right muscles.\\n*   **Start Light:** It's better to use a lighter weight and perform the exercise correctly than to use a heavy weight with poor form. You can always increase the weight as you get stronger.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Some muscle soreness (DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) is normal when you start, but sharp pain is not. If something hurts, stop.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to your 3 days a week. Showing up consistently is more important than having a perfect workout every time.\\n*   **Nutrition & Hydration:** Support your muscle growth by eating a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Rest & Recovery:** Your muscles grow when you rest, not when you're working out. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\\n\\nYou've got this, John! This plan will set you on a great path to building muscle and gaining strength.

A slight caloric surplus can also aid in muscle building.\\n*   **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Muscle growth happens during rest, not just in the gym.\\n*   **Consistency:** Stick to this plan for 4-6 weeks, focusing on progressive overload.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise. Don\\'t be afraid to take an extra rest day if you\\'re feeling overly fatigued.\\n*   **Vary Your Rep Ranges:** This plan already incorporates this, but remember that mixing heavy, low-rep sets with moderate-weight, higher-rep sets is crucial for comprehensive development.\\n*   **Mind-Muscle Connection:** For every rep, consciously focus on squeezing and contracting your chest muscles. This can significantly improve activation and growth.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Stay consistent, push hard, and you\\'ll be shattering that bench press plateau in no time.

Lower them slowly and with control, feeling a stretch in your upper chest.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** Specifically targets the upper pectorals, which often lag in development, contributing to a fuller, more aesthetic chest. Dumbbells allow for a greater range of motion and independent limb movement.\\n\\n3.  **Cable Crossover (Mid-Pulley)**\\n    *   **Sets:** 3 sets\\n    *   **Reps:** 12-15 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand in the middle of a cable crossover machine, with pulleys set at chest height. Grab a handle in each hand, step forward slightly, and lean forward at your hips. With a slight bend in your elbows, bring the handles together in front of your chest, squeezing your pecs hard at the peak contraction. Control the eccentric (return) phase, allowing a good stretch.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** Excellent for isolating the chest muscles, improving definition, and providing a strong \"pump.\" The constant tension from the cables is great for hypertrophy.\\n\\n4.  **Dumbbell Pullover**\\n    *   **Sets:** 3 sets\\n    *   **Reps:** 10-12 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Lie perpendicular on a flat bench, with only your upper back supported. Hold one dumbbell with both hands, cupping one end, directly over your chest. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head, feeling a deep stretch in your chest and lats. Pull the dumbbell back over your chest using your pecs.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** A unique exercise that stretches the rib cage and works the sternal head of the pectorals, contributing to overall chest thickness and expansion. Also engages the lats and serratus anterior.\\n\\n5.  **Weighted Dips (Chest Version)**\\n    *   **Sets:** 3 sets\\n    *   **Reps:** 8-12 repetitions (or to failure if using bodyweight)\\n    *   **Instructions:** Use a dip station. To emphasize the chest, lean your torso forward significantly and allow your elbows to flare out slightly. Lower your body until your shoulders are below your elbows, feeling a deep stretch in your lower chest. Push back up powerfully. If 8-12 reps are easy, add weight using a dip belt or holding a dumbbell between your feet.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** A powerful compound exercise for building strength and mass in the lower chest and triceps. It\\'s excellent for improving overall pushing power and can be progressively overloaded.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\nThis phase helps improve flexibility, reduce muscle soreness, and aid in recovery. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n1.  **Pec Stretch (Doorway Stretch):**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand in a doorway with one arm (or both) bent at a 90-degree angle, forearm resting against the doorframe. Gently lean forward until you feel a stretch across your chest and front of your shoulder.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the pectoralis major and minor, improving chest flexibility.\\n\\n2.  **Overhead Triceps Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Raise one arm overhead, bend your elbow, and let your hand drop behind your head. Use your other hand to gently pull the elbow further back, feeling a stretch in your triceps.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the triceps, which are heavily involved in pressing movements.\\n\\n3.  **Child\\'s Pose:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Kneel on the floor, sit your hips back towards your heels, and extend your arms forward, resting your forehead on the ground.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Gently stretches the back, shoulders, and hips, promoting relaxation.\\n\\n4.  **Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Bring one arm across your body at shoulder height. Use your other hand to gently pull the elbow closer to your chest, feeling a stretch in your shoulder and upper back.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the deltoids and rotator cuff muscles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Additional Tips for Breaking the Plateau:**\\n\\n*   **Nutrition:** Ensure you\\'re consuming enough protein (around 1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight) to support muscle repair and growth. A slight caloric surplus can also aid in muscle building.\\n*   **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Muscle growth happens during rest, not just in the gym.\\n*   **Consistency:** Stick to this plan for 4-6 weeks, focusing on progressive overload.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise. Don\\'t be afraid to take an extra rest day if you\\'re feeling overly fatigued.\\n*   **Vary Your Rep Ranges:** This plan already incorporates this, but remember that mixing heavy, low-rep sets with moderate-weight, higher-rep sets is crucial for comprehensive development.\\n*   **Mind-Muscle Connection:** For every rep, consciously focus on squeezing and contracting your chest muscles. This can significantly improve activation and growth.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Stay consistent, push hard, and you\\'ll be shattering that bench press plateau in no time.

If something causes sharp pain, stop immediately. Soreness is normal, but pain is not.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To continue building muscle and losing fat, you\\'ll need to gradually increase the challenge over time. This can mean:\\n    *   Increasing the weight you lift.\\n    *   Increasing the number of repetitions or sets.\\n    *   Decreasing rest time between sets.\\n    *   Improving your form.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to your 4 days a week. Even on days you don\\'t feel like it, a shorter, lighter session is better than skipping entirely.\\n*   **Nutrition:** Remember, \"abs are made in the kitchen.\" To achieve fat loss and muscle definition, your diet is paramount. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, adequate protein intake, and managing your calorie intake.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night for optimal recovery and muscle growth.\\n\\nThis plan provides a solid foundation. As you get stronger and more comfortable, we can adjust the exercises, introduce new techniques, and increase the intensity to keep you progressing towards your goal of getting ripped and building lean muscle!\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John!

Focus on lean protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, with plenty of vegetables.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise. Some muscle soreness is normal, but distinguish it from injury.\\n*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night for optimal recovery and hormone regulation.\\n\\nThis detailed plan for Day 1 should give you a strong foundation. We can build out the remaining days of your 5-day split with similar intensity and focus, ensuring all major muscle groups are hit effectively for your aggressive fat loss and muscle definition goals.\\n\\nYou've got this, John!

We'll focus on full-body workouts to maximize your progress in three sessions per week, allowing ample time for recovery.\\n\\nRemember, consistency is key, and proper form is always more important than lifting heavy weight.

Watch videos, use mirrors, and if unsure, ask a gym staff member for a quick form check.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To build muscle and strength, you need to gradually challenge your muscles. Once you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, increase the weight slightly (e.g., 2.5-5 lbs) or add 1-2 more reps.\\n*   **Rest Between Sets:** Aim for 60-90 seconds of rest between sets to allow your muscles to recover enough for the next set.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If something causes sharp pain, stop immediately. Muscle soreness is normal, but pain is not.\\n*   **Hydration & Nutrition:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day and fuel your body with balanced meals to support muscle growth and recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Workout Plan (Repeat this session 3 times per week)\\n\\n#### Phase 1: Warm-up (5-10 minutes)\\n\\nThis phase prepares your body for exercise by increasing blood flow, warming up your muscles, and improving joint mobility.\\n\\n*   **Light Cardio (5 minutes):**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Hop on a treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike.

Control the movement as you bring your leg back.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** Targets the gluteus medius and minimus, which are crucial for hip stability, preventing injury, and contributing to the \"shelf\" or side glute development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (7 minutes)**\\n*This phase helps to improve flexibility, reduce muscle soreness, and promote recovery.*\\n\\nHold each stretch for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply.\\n\\n1.  **Pigeon Stretch (20-30 seconds per side)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Start on all fours. Bring one knee forward towards your wrist, and angle your shin across your body. Extend the other leg straight back. Lower your hips towards the floor. You can stay upright or fold forward over your front leg.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Deep stretch for the glutes and hips.\\n\\n2.  **Supine Figure-4 Stretch (20-30 seconds per side)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat. Cross one ankle over the opposite knee. Gently pull the thigh of the uncrossed leg towards your chest, feeling the stretch in the glute of the crossed leg.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the piriformis and gluteal muscles.\\n\\n3.  **Standing Quad Stretch (20-30 seconds per side)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall, holding onto something for balance if needed. Grab one ankle with the hand on the same side and gently pull your heel towards your glute, keeping your knees together.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the quadriceps, which can become tight from lower body workouts.\\n\\n4.  **Standing Hamstring Stretch (20-30 seconds per side)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Place one heel on a slightly elevated surface (like a step or low bench), keeping your leg straight but not locked. Hinge forward at your hips, keeping your back straight, until you feel a stretch in your hamstring.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Stretches the hamstrings, which work closely with the glutes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Important Considerations for Glute Growth:**\\n\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To continue seeing results, you must progressively challenge your muscles. This means gradually increasing the weight you lift, the number of reps, or the number of sets over time.\\n*   **Form Over Weight:** Always prioritize proper form. Lifting too heavy with poor form can lead to injury and less effective muscle activation.\\n*   **Nutrition:** Muscle growth requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.\\n*   **Consistency:** Stick to your plan! Consistency is key for long-term results.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise. Allow for adequate rest and recovery between sessions.\\n\\nThis workout is designed to be challenging and effective for your glute-building goals. Give it your all, stay consistent, and you\\'ll definitely start seeing and feeling the results you\\'re looking for!\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, Sarah!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-a790066d-d42d-4750-bd19-4504d2fe27aa-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 574, 'output_tokens': 2091, 'total_tokens': 4336, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]} \n",

Essential for balanced leg development and an aesthetic physique.\\n\\n3.  **Walking Lunges (Bodyweight or Light Dumbbells)**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions per leg (16-20 total steps per set)\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Ensure your front knee is directly over your ankle and your back knee hovers just above the ground. Push off your back foot to bring it forward, stepping into the next lunge with the opposite leg. Continue alternating legs as you \"walk\" forward. If using dumbbells, hold one in each hand by your sides.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** Builds unilateral leg strength, improving balance, coordination, and effectively targeting your quads, glutes, and hamstrings.\\n\\n4.  **Standing Calf Raises**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, either on a flat surface or with the balls of your feet on a slightly elevated surface (like a step) for a greater range of motion.

Slowly lower your heels back down, feeling a stretch in your calves.\\n    *   **Key Benefits:** Specifically targets the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus), contributing to overall leg aesthetics and lower leg strength.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (5-10 minutes)**\\n*   **Purpose:** To gradually lower your heart rate, improve flexibility, and aid muscle recovery. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply.\\n\\n1.  **Quad Stretch**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall, grab your right ankle with your right hand, and gently pull your heel towards your glutes. Keep your knees together and feel the stretch in the front of your thigh. Use a wall or chair for balance if needed. Repeat on the left leg.\\n\\n2.  **Hamstring Stretch**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Sit on the floor with one leg extended straight out. Bend the other leg, placing the sole of your foot against the inner thigh of the extended leg. Lean forward from your hips, reaching towards your toes while keeping your back straight. Repeat on the other side.\\n\\n3.  **Glute Stretch (Figure-Four)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Cross your right ankle over your left knee. Gently pull your left thigh towards your chest until you feel a stretch in your right glute. Repeat on the other side.\\n\\n4.  **Calf Stretch**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand facing a wall, placing your hands on the wall for support. Step one foot back, keeping the heel on the ground and the leg straight. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your calf. Repeat on the other side.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Important Notes for Your Journey:**\\n\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** As a beginner, some muscle soreness (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness or DOMS) is normal, especially in the first few weeks. However, sharp pain is a sign to stop.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To continue building muscle, you\\'ll need to gradually increase the challenge over time. This could mean:\\n    *   Increasing the weight of the dumbbells you use.\\n    *   Increasing the number of repetitions (e.g., from 10 to 12).\\n    *   Increasing the number of sets (e.g., from 3 to 4, but only after several weeks of consistency and comfort with the current volume).\\n*   **Nutrition & Recovery:** Muscle growth happens outside the gym. Ensure you\\'re consuming enough protein (lean meats, eggs, dairy, legumes) and getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours) to support your recovery and muscle building goals.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Sticking to your one workout day per week consistently will yield the best results. Each session is an opportunity to get stronger and build the physique you desire.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Stay consistent, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-774bfdec-55fe-4c6a-9700-6608b2b7301f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 576, 'output_tokens': 1979, 'total_tokens': 4812, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]} \n",

Cool-down & Stretching (5-10 minutes)**\\n*   **Same as Day 3 cool-down.** Focus on comprehensive lower body stretches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Considerations for Your Journey:\\n\\n*   **Nutrition:** To build muscle, you need to be in a caloric surplus (eating more calories than you burn) and consume adequate protein (aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight daily). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially around your workouts.\\n*   **Rest & Recovery:** Muscle growth happens outside the gym. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Consider active recovery on rest days (light walks, stretching).\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience sharp pain, stop the exercise. Some muscle soreness (DOMS) is normal, but distinguish it from pain. Don't be afraid to take an extra rest day if you feel overly fatigued or on the verge of overtraining.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to the plan as much as possible. Small, consistent efforts lead to big results over time.\\n\\nThis program is designed to be challenging and effective. Stay disciplined, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger and building the physique you desire.

Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially around your workouts.\\n*   **Rest & Recovery:** Muscle growth happens outside the gym. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Consider active recovery on rest days (light walks, stretching).\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience sharp pain, stop the exercise. Some muscle soreness (DOMS) is normal, but distinguish it from pain. Don't be afraid to take an extra rest day if you feel overly fatigued or on the verge of overtraining.\\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Stick to the plan as much as possible. Small, consistent efforts lead to big results over time.\\n\\nThis program is designed to be challenging and effective. Stay disciplined, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger and building the physique you desire.

For example: Monday, Wednesday, Friday.\\n\\n**Important Notes Before You Start:**\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If an exercise causes pain, stop immediately. It's okay to modify or skip an exercise if needed.\\n*   **Focus on Form:** Always prioritize correct form over lifting heavy weights. Start with lighter dumbbells to master the movement, then gradually increase the weight as you get stronger.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To build muscle, you need to challenge your body over time. This means gradually increasing the weight of your dumbbells, the number of repetitions, or the number of sets as you get stronger.\\n*   **Hydration & Nutrition:** Remember to drink plenty of water and fuel your body with nutritious foods to support muscle growth and recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Phase 1: Warm-up (5 minutes)\\n\\nThis phase prepares your body for the workout by increasing blood flow and mobility, reducing the risk of injury. Perform each movement for 30-60 seconds.\\n\\n1.  **Arm Circles (Forward & Backward)**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall with arms extended out to your sides.

If your form breaks down, reduce the weight until you can perform the exercise correctly.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when needed. If a muscle group is still very sore, consider active recovery (light cardio, stretching) or light training instead of heavy lifting for that area.\\n*   **Nutrition & Recovery:** Remember that muscle growth happens outside the gym. Ensure you\\'re consuming enough protein (around 1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight), getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours), and staying well-hydrated. These are crucial for recovery and muscle repair.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Consistency and dedication will be key to achieving your goals.

Pull the band apart, squeezing your shoulder blades together.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Activates the rear deltoids and upper back, improving shoulder stability and posture.\\n    *   **Light Dumbbell Overhead Press (Empty Barbell or Light Dumbbells):** 1 set of 10-12 reps.\\n        *   **Instructions:** Use a very light weight to perform controlled overhead presses, focusing on the movement pattern.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Primes the pressing muscles and reinforces proper overhead mechanics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 2: Main Workout (High Intensity)**\\n\\nThis phase is designed for maximum muscle hypertrophy and strength gains, utilizing heavy compounds and advanced techniques.\\n\\n**1. Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)**\\n    *   **Sets & Reps:** 4 sets of 5-8 reps\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell at your upper chest with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Press the bar directly overhead until your arms are fully extended, locking out your elbows. Lower the bar slowly and with control back to the starting position. Maintain a tight core throughout.\\n    *   **Benefit:** A foundational compound lift that builds immense strength and mass in all three heads of the deltoid, triceps, and core. It\\'s excellent for overall shoulder development.\\n\\n**2. Superset 1: Dumbbell Lateral Raises & Cable Front Raises**\\n    *   **Sets & Reps:** 3 supersets of 10-12 reps for each exercise. Rest 60-90 seconds between supersets.\\n    *   **A. Dumbbell Lateral Raises:**\\n        *   **Instructions:** Stand with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells out to the sides until your arms are parallel to the floor, forming a \"T\" shape. Focus on leading with your elbows. Lower slowly.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Primarily targets the lateral (side) deltoids, crucial for creating wider, fuller shoulders.\\n    *   **B. Cable Front Raises:**\\n        *   **Instructions:** Stand facing a low cable pulley, holding a D-handle with an overhand grip. Keeping your arm straight (slight elbow bend), raise the handle directly in front of you to shoulder height. Control the movement on the way down.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Isolates the anterior (front) deltoids, contributing to the \"capped\" look of the shoulders. Cables provide constant tension throughout the movement.\\n\\n**3. Reverse Pec Deck Flyes (or Cable Rear Delt Flyes)**\\n    *   **Sets & Reps:** 3 sets of 12-15 reps. Rest 60 seconds between sets.\\n    *   **Instructions:** Adjust the machine so your chest is against the pad and your arms are extended forward. Grab the handles with a neutral grip. Squeeze your shoulder blades together, pulling the handles back as far as possible, focusing on contracting your rear deltoids. Slowly return to the starting position. If using cables, stand facing the cable machine, grab the opposite handle with each hand, and pull your arms out to the sides, squeezing your rear delts.\\n    *   **Benefit:** Develops the often-neglected posterior (rear) deltoids, which are vital for balanced shoulder development, improved posture, and injury prevention.\\n\\n**4. Barbell Shrugs**\\n    *   **Sets & Reps:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps. On the **last set, perform a drop set.**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall, holding a barbell in front of you with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Keep your arms straight and shoulders relaxed. Shrug your shoulders straight up towards your ears, squeezing your traps at the top. Slowly lower the bar back down. Avoid rolling your shoulders.\\n    *   **Drop Set (on final set):** After reaching failure on your last set, immediately reduce the weight by 20-30% and continue performing reps to failure again. This maximizes muscle fiber recruitment and promotes hypertrophy.\\n    *   **Benefit:** Directly targets and builds the trapezius muscles, adding significant mass and thickness to the upper back and neck area.\\n\\n**5. Superset 2: Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press & Dumbbell Upright Rows**\\n    *   **Sets & Reps:** 3 supersets of 8-10 reps for Seated Dumbbell Press, and 10-12 reps for Dumbbell Upright Rows. Rest 60-90 seconds between supersets.\\n    *   **A. Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press:**\\n        *   **Instructions:** Sit on a bench with back support, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward. Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms are fully extended, but don\\'t lock out your elbows. Control the descent back to the starting position.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Provides a different angle of attack for the deltoids compared to the standing barbell press, allowing for a strong contraction and promoting hypertrophy.\\n    *   **B. Dumbbell Upright Rows:**\\n        *   **Instructions:** Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand in front of your thighs, palms facing your body. Pull the dumbbells straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows. Keep the dumbbells close to your body. Your elbows should go higher than your hands. Control the descent.\\n        *   **Important Note:** If you experience any shoulder discomfort with this exercise, substitute it with a high-rep set of Dumbbell Lateral Raises or Machine Shoulder Press to failure.\\n        *   **Benefit:** Works both the lateral deltoids and the trapezius muscles, providing a powerful finishing pump and hitting these muscles from a slightly different angle.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (10 minutes)**\\n\\nThis phase helps reduce muscle soreness, improve flexibility, and promote recovery. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n1.  **Overhead Triceps Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Raise one arm overhead, bend your elbow, and let your hand drop behind your head. Use your other hand to gently push down on the elbow, deepening the stretch.\\n    *   **Benefit:** Stretches the triceps and provides a gentle stretch to the lats and shoulders.\\n2.  **Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Bring one arm across your body at shoulder height. Use your other hand to gently pull the elbow closer to your chest.\\n    *   **Benefit:** Stretches the posterior deltoid and rotator cuff muscles.\\n3.  **Doorway Chest/Shoulder Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand in a doorway, place your forearms on the doorframe with elbows bent at 90 degrees. Lean forward gently until you feel a stretch in your chest and front shoulders.\\n    *   **Benefit:** Opens up the chest and stretches the anterior deltoids, which can become tight from pressing movements.\\n4.  **Neck/Trap Stretch:**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder.

Keep your elbow bent at 90 degrees and tucked into your side. Rotate your forearm upwards, lifting the dumbbell towards the ceiling, keeping your elbow stationary. Slowly lower.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Strengthens the rotator cuff muscles, which are vital for shoulder health and injury prevention, especially with heavy pressing.\\n\\n4.  **Scapular Push-ups (on Knees or Toes)**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Get into a push-up position (on knees or toes). Keeping your arms straight, allow your chest to sink towards the floor by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Then, push your upper back towards the ceiling, protracting your shoulder blades. Your elbows should remain locked.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Improves scapular control and stability, which is foundational for all pressing movements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 2: Main Workout (High-Intensity Deltoid Focus)**\\n\\nThis phase is designed for maximum muscle stimulation, hitting all three heads of your deltoids with a combination of heavy compounds and targeted isolation work, incorporating advanced techniques.\\n\\n1.  **Standing Barbell Overhead Press**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with the barbell racked at shoulder height. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Unrack the bar, taking a deep breath, and press it directly overhead until your arms are fully extended and your head is slightly pushed through. Control the descent back to the starting position. Maintain a tight core and glutes to prevent excessive arching of the lower back.\\n    *   **Benefits:** A foundational compound exercise that builds overall shoulder strength and mass, primarily targeting the anterior and lateral deltoids, while also engaging the triceps and core.\\n\\n2.  **Superset: Dumbbell Lateral Raises & Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 supersets (perform A immediately followed by B, then rest)\\n        *   **A. Dumbbell Lateral Raises:** 10-12 repetitions\\n        *   **B. Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes:** 12-15 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions (A. Dumbbell Lateral Raises):** Stand tall, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your body. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells out to your sides until your arms are parallel to the floor, forming a \"T\" shape. Focus on leading with your elbows and feeling the contraction in your lateral deltoids. Slowly lower with control. Avoid swinging.\\n        *   **Benefits:** Excellent for isolating and building the lateral (side) deltoid head, which contributes significantly to shoulder width and cap.\\n    *   **Instructions (B. Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes):** Hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and a slight bend in your knees, until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor. Let the dumbbells hang directly below your shoulders, palms facing each other. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells out to your sides in an arc, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top. Focus on feeling the contraction in your rear deltoids. Slowly lower.\\n        *   **Benefits:** Directly targets the posterior (rear) deltoids, crucial for balanced shoulder development, posture, and preventing shoulder imbalances.\\n\\n3.  **Machine Shoulder Press (or Seated Dumbbell Press)**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions (perform a **drop set** on the final set)\\n    *   **Instructions:** Adjust the machine so the handles are at shoulder height. Sit with your back firmly against the pad. Press the handles overhead until your arms are fully extended, but avoid locking out your elbows. Control the negative phase as you lower the weight.\\n        *   **Drop Set:** On your final set, after completing your 8-10 reps, immediately reduce the weight by 20-30% and perform as many reps as possible to failure. Then, reduce the weight again by 20-30% and go to failure one last time.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Provides a stable environment to push to failure safely, effectively targeting the anterior and lateral deltoids with consistent tension. The drop set maximizes muscle fiber recruitment and metabolic stress for hypertrophy.\\n\\n4.  **Cable Face Pulls**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Set a rope attachment on a cable machine at upper chest or eye level. Grab the rope with an overhand grip (palms facing down) or a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Step back to create tension. Pull the rope towards your face, flaring your elbows out and squeezing your shoulder blades together. Focus on externally rotating your shoulders as you pull. Control the return.\\n    *   **Benefits:** One of the best exercises for targeting the posterior deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, improving shoulder health, stability, and posture. The high rep range emphasizes muscle endurance and mind-muscle connection.\\n\\n5.  **Dumbbell Front Raises**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your thighs.

      "Returned: {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Hello John,\\n\\nIt\\'s great to hear you\\'re an advanced lifter ready to tackle your lagging deltoids with a high-volume, high-intensity approach! This plan is specifically designed to hit all three heads of your deltoids (anterior, lateral, and posterior) with a mix of compound and isolation movements, leveraging your access to a full gym. Consistency and proper form will be key to bringing up your shoulder mass and strength.\\n\\nLet\\'s get those deltoids growing!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **High-Volume, High-Intensity Deltoid Domination Workout**\\n\\n**Goal:** Increase shoulder mass and strength, specifically targeting lagging deltoids.\\n**Focus:** High volume, high intensity, targeting all three deltoid heads.\\n**Equipment:** Barbell, Dumbbells, Cables, Machines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 1: Warm-up (10 minutes)**\\n\\nThe goal of the warm-up is to increase blood flow, prepare your joints, and activate the muscles involved in your shoulder workout, reducing the risk of injury.\\n\\n1.  **Arm Circles (Forward & Backward)**\\n    *   **Duration:** 30 seconds each direction\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall with arms extended straight out to your sides. Make small circles, gradually increasing the size. After 30 seconds, reverse direction.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Improves shoulder joint mobility and warms up the rotator cuff muscles.\\n\\n2.  **Band Pull-Aparts**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2 sets of 15-20 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Hold a resistance band with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart, arms extended straight in front of you at shoulder height. Keeping your arms straight, pull the band apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together until the band touches your chest. Slowly return to the start.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Activates the posterior deltoids and upper back muscles, crucial for shoulder stability and posture.\\n\\n3.  **Light Dumbbell External Rotations**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions per arm\\n    *   **Instructions:** Lie on your side, holding a very light dumbbell (1-2 kg) in your top hand. Keep your elbow bent at 90 degrees and tucked into your side. Rotate your forearm upwards, lifting the dumbbell towards the ceiling, keeping your elbow stationary. Slowly lower.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Strengthens the rotator cuff muscles, which are vital for shoulder health and injury prevention, especially with heavy pressing.\\n\\n4.  **Scapular Push-ups (on Knees or Toes)**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Get into a push-up position (on knees or toes). Keeping your arms straight, allow your chest to sink towards the floor by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Then, push your upper back towards the ceiling, protracting your shoulder blades. Your elbows should remain locked.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Improves scapular control and stability, which is foundational for all pressing movements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 2: Main Workout (High-Intensity Deltoid Focus)**\\n\\nThis phase is designed for maximum muscle stimulation, hitting all three heads of your deltoids with a combination of heavy compounds and targeted isolation work, incorporating advanced techniques.\\n\\n1.  **Standing Barbell Overhead Press**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand with the barbell racked at shoulder height. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Unrack the bar, taking a deep breath, and press it directly overhead until your arms are fully extended and your head is slightly pushed through. Control the descent back to the starting position. Maintain a tight core and glutes to prevent excessive arching of the lower back.\\n    *   **Benefits:** A foundational compound exercise that builds overall shoulder strength and mass, primarily targeting the anterior and lateral deltoids, while also engaging the triceps and core.\\n\\n2.  **Superset: Dumbbell Lateral Raises & Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 supersets (perform A immediately followed by B, then rest)\\n        *   **A. Dumbbell Lateral Raises:** 10-12 repetitions\\n        *   **B. Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes:** 12-15 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions (A. Dumbbell Lateral Raises):** Stand tall, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your body. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells out to your sides until your arms are parallel to the floor, forming a \"T\" shape. Focus on leading with your elbows and feeling the contraction in your lateral deltoids. Slowly lower with control. Avoid swinging.\\n        *   **Benefits:** Excellent for isolating and building the lateral (side) deltoid head, which contributes significantly to shoulder width and cap.\\n    *   **Instructions (B. Bent-Over Dumbbell Reverse Flyes):** Hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and a slight bend in your knees, until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor. Let the dumbbells hang directly below your shoulders, palms facing each other. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells out to your sides in an arc, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top. Focus on feeling the contraction in your rear deltoids. Slowly lower.\\n        *   **Benefits:** Directly targets the posterior (rear) deltoids, crucial for balanced shoulder development, posture, and preventing shoulder imbalances.\\n\\n3.  **Machine Shoulder Press (or Seated Dumbbell Press)**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions (perform a **drop set** on the final set)\\n    *   **Instructions:** Adjust the machine so the handles are at shoulder height. Sit with your back firmly against the pad. Press the handles overhead until your arms are fully extended, but avoid locking out your elbows. Control the negative phase as you lower the weight.\\n        *   **Drop Set:** On your final set, after completing your 8-10 reps, immediately reduce the weight by 20-30% and perform as many reps as possible to failure. Then, reduce the weight again by 20-30% and go to failure one last time.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Provides a stable environment to push to failure safely, effectively targeting the anterior and lateral deltoids with consistent tension. The drop set maximizes muscle fiber recruitment and metabolic stress for hypertrophy.\\n\\n4.  **Cable Face Pulls**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Set a rope attachment on a cable machine at upper chest or eye level. Grab the rope with an overhand grip (palms facing down) or a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Step back to create tension. Pull the rope towards your face, flaring your elbows out and squeezing your shoulder blades together. Focus on externally rotating your shoulders as you pull. Control the return.\\n    *   **Benefits:** One of the best exercises for targeting the posterior deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, improving shoulder health, stability, and posture. The high rep range emphasizes muscle endurance and mind-muscle connection.\\n\\n5.  **Dumbbell Front Raises**\\n    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions\\n    *   **Instructions:** Stand tall, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your thighs. Keeping your arms straight (but not locked), raise one dumbbell directly in front of you to shoulder height. Control the descent. Alternate arms or perform with both arms simultaneously. Avoid swinging or using momentum.\\n    *   **Benefits:** Isolates the anterior (front) deltoid, contributing to the overall fullness and definition of the front of the shoulder.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Phase 3: Cool-down & Stretching (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\nThis phase helps to gradually lower your heart rate, improve flexibility, and aid in muscle recovery. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply.\\n\\n1.  **Cross-Body Arm Stretch**\\n    *   **Instructions:** Bring one arm across your chest.

Focus on gentle stretches for chest, shoulders, back, and hips. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Important Considerations for Your Success:**\\n\\n*   **Form Over Weight:** Always prioritize perfect form. It\\'s better to lift lighter with good technique than to lift heavy with poor form and risk injury. Watch videos, and don\\'t hesitate to ask gym staff for a form check.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** This is the key to strength gain. Once you can comfortably complete all sets and reps for an exercise with good form, it\\'s time to increase the weight slightly (e.g., 2.5kg/5lbs). If you can\\'t complete the reps, reduce the weight.\\n*   **Rest Between Sets:** For strength-focused exercises (like bench press, squats, overhead press), aim for 60-90 seconds of rest between sets. For accessory exercises, 45-60 seconds is usually sufficient.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise immediately. Some muscle soreness (DOMS) is normal, especially as a beginner, but pain is not.\\n*   **Nutrition:** Fuel your body! Ensure you\\'re consuming enough protein (lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes) to support muscle repair and growth, along with complex carbohydrates for energy and healthy fats.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. This is when your muscles recover and grow.\\n*   **Consistency:** Stick to your 4-day schedule as much as possible. Missing a day occasionally is fine, just get back on track.\\n*   **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal or use an app to record the weights, sets, and reps you perform. This will help you see your progress and know when to increase the challenge.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Stay consistent, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger.

Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Important Considerations for Your Success:**\\n\\n*   **Form Over Weight:** Always prioritize perfect form. It\\'s better to lift lighter with good technique than to lift heavy with poor form and risk injury. Watch videos, and don\\'t hesitate to ask gym staff for a form check.\\n*   **Progressive Overload:** This is the key to strength gain. Once you can comfortably complete all sets and reps for an exercise with good form, it\\'s time to increase the weight slightly (e.g., 2.5kg/5lbs). If you can\\'t complete the reps, reduce the weight.\\n*   **Rest Between Sets:** For strength-focused exercises (like bench press, squats, overhead press), aim for 60-90 seconds of rest between sets. For accessory exercises, 45-60 seconds is usually sufficient.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel sharp pain, stop the exercise immediately. Some muscle soreness (DOMS) is normal, especially as a beginner, but pain is not.\\n*   **Nutrition:** Fuel your body! Ensure you\\'re consuming enough protein (lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes) to support muscle repair and growth, along with complex carbohydrates for energy and healthy fats.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. This is when your muscles recover and grow.\\n*   **Consistency:** Stick to your 4-day schedule as much as possible. Missing a day occasionally is fine, just get back on track.\\n*   **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal or use an app to record the weights, sets, and reps you perform. This will help you see your progress and know when to increase the challenge.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John! Stay consistent, focus on your form, and enjoy the process of getting stronger.

Choose a weight that allows you to complete all reps with good form, but is challenging by the last 1-2 reps.\\n*   **Weeks 5-8 (Phase 2):** Once you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, aim to increase the weight slightly (e.g., 2.5-5 lbs for dumbbells, 5-10 lbs for barbells). You might also consider dropping the rep range slightly for some compound exercises (e.g., 5-7 reps) to focus more on pure strength.\\n*   **Beyond:** Continue to apply progressive overload. You can also explore variations of exercises (e.g., front squats, deficit deadlifts, different grip bench presses) to keep challenging your muscles in new ways.\\n\\nRemember, consistency is your most powerful tool. Stick with this plan, focus on your form, and you\\'ll be amazed at the strength you build!\\n\\nYou\\'ve got this, John!

This notion is supported by the fact that if the athlete already has an adequate level of strength, then the increases in maximal power performance in response to traditional strength training will be poor. More specific training interventions will be required to further improve maximal power output (45). Thus, improvement of maximal power output in trained athletes may require more complex training strategies than previously thought (102).\\n\\nThis contention is supported by research (101) comparing changes in 1RM squat, vertical jump, and flying 20 m sprint velocity during eight weeks of either weight training or plyometric training. Subjects were classified as weak or strong based on their pretraining 1RM squat. The results demonstrated significant negative relationships between improvements induced by weight training in sprinting, jumping, and pretraining 1RM performance. The authors hypothesized that this was due to the principle of diminishing returns, whereby initial improvements in muscular function are easily attained, but further improvements are progressively harder to achieve. Unexpectedly, the performance gains from the plyometric training were unrelated to initial strength levels.\\n\\nFIGURE 5.3 Changes to the force–velocity and force–power relationships for the jump squat (i.e., a CMJ with a bar held across the shoulders) in response to 10 weeks of heavy resistance training (a and b) and ballistic power training (c and d).

The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25).

For example, a progression from monoaxial to multiaxial balance board is recommended. Athletes should also progress from a bigger to a smaller support surface and incorporate longer work intervals, additional tasks, and a higher frequency of oscillation into their routines. When athletes master a movement, the strength and conditioning professional should upgrade it or introduce a new, unfamiliar movement. Since adaptations of the neuromuscular system are induced by increasing the demand of conducting a task, this rule should be followed.\\n\\nStability Training for Joint Systems\\n\\nBy following the directions presented here when planning training for balance and functional joint stabilization, appropriate exercises and training quantity can be chosen. Since different joint systems are usually stressed in training, some specifics should be considered. The following sections describe these in more detail.\\n\\nTorso and Core\\n\\nThe human torso consists of the spine, pelvis, hips, abdomen, and the rib cage. It is one of the most important systems, enabling human motion in daily and sport activities. As such, it is a base for upper and lower limb movement and enables transfer of energy and force from the legs to the arms. For example, in its final stage, the javelin throw demands a synchronized movement of the legs and torso to transfer additional power from the lower body to the shoulder girdle, arms, and,\\n\\nfinally, to the javelin. On the other hand, a strong and stable torso enables humans to perform elevation of heavy loads and rotational movements, preventing possibly harmful movement and stress to the spinal column. It is the center of the functional kinetic chain, enabling movement of the body and different body parts. The muscles surrounding the abdominal cavity produce a corset that stabilizes the upper body, particularly the spine.\\n\\nIn popular literature, torso stability has also been called core stability, stressing its central role in human movement. Torso stability exercises should be used in rehabilitation. Stabilization of the spinal column involves the abdominal muscles, especially the transversus abdominis, part of the internal oblique, the diaphragm, and the pelvic floor muscles. Their contraction results in an increase in intra- abdominal pressure, supporting the rib cage and pelvis. This results in decreased compressive and torsion stress, especially on the lumbar spinal column.\\n\\nStudies of patients (including athletes) show that coordinating the muscles that stabilize the spinal column may be effective for treating lower back injuries (2). The combination of strength and balance training attempts to reestablish appropriate torso strength and stability. The primary issues associated with activation patterns of multiple trunk muscles among people suffering from back injury are as follows:\\n\\nDecreased sense of position and repositioning of the torso Delayed stabilizing muscle response Diminished or even missing preactivation of torso muscles in rapid distal\\n\\nmovements, causing lower back pain Impaired recruitment of the torso musculature during fast and explosive movements\\n\\nIncreased body sway'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Day 1 – Upper Body Strength & Definition\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 8–12 | Focus on control, use lighter weights to preserve form |\\n| Dumbbell Bent-Over Rows | 3 | 8–12 | Keep back flat, squeeze shoulder blades at top |\\n| Lateral Dumbbell Raises | 3 | 10–15 | Raise dumbbells to shoulder height, target delts |\\n| Dumbbell Reverse Flyes | 3 | 10–15 | Slight bend at hips, focus on rear delts & upper back |\\n| Dumbbell Shrugs | 3 | 12–15 | Elevate shoulders, squeeze traps at the top |\\n| Plank (core stability) | 3 | 30–45s | Engage core, maintain straight line |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Day 2 – Upper Body Strength & Definition\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Overhead Press | 3 | 8–12 | Keep core tight, control movement on the way down |\\n| Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows | 3 | 8–12 each arm | Focus on squeezing back muscles, stabilize core |\\n| Dumbbell Lateral Raises | 3 | 10–15 | Use light weight, avoid momentum |\\n| Rear Delt Flyes (on incline or bent over) | 3 | 10–15 | Focus on posterior chain of shoulders |\\n| Dumbbell Upright Rows | 3 | 8–12 | Keep elbows high, stay controlled |\\n| Dead Bug (core stability) | 3 | 30–45s | Engage abs, maintain neutral spine |\\n\\nThis plan emphasizes progressive control and volume suitable for beginners, focusing on balanced development of back and shoulder muscles.

Malek (eds.), 2012, NSCA’s\\n\\nExisting strength training guidelines suggest that primary exercises (complex multi-joint movements) be performed first, followed by assistance exercises (smaller muscles/muscle groups and single-joint movements). Standard exercise order seems to be the most effective for optimal strength gains because it allows greater recovery between sets compared to muscular endurance or hypertrophy training. Max strength training is typically performed by movement groups (as opposed to training individual body parts), such as push (e.g., squat, lunge, bench press, etc.), pull (e.g., deadlift, bent-over row, etc.), and press (e.g., military press, etc.). Clients with more experience who are more advanced may further break down the movements into lower-body push, lower-body pull, upper-body push, upper-body pull, and press (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\nessentials of personal training, 2nd ed.

The muscular strength phase employs heavy loads (e.g., 1 – 6RM) and longer rest periods to increase the maximal level of force a muscle (or group of muscles) can generate, regardless of time.\\n\\nAn example strength workout might include 1 – 3 strength exercises, such as the back squat and bench press (3 – 6 sets of 3 – 6 reps with 3 min of rest) followed by assistance/complementary movements using hypertrophy variables, such as walking lunges, leg extensions, dumbbell flies, and triceps extensions (3 sets of 8 – 12 reps with 1 min of rest).\\n\\nOther program design techniques commonly used to increase maximum strength include cluster sets, the use of accommodating resistance, partial range of motion, and isometric work (Schoenfeld, 2011).', '54.

Subsequent sets of a given exercise must begin before complete recovery has been reached, which causes increased metabolic stress (Buresh, Berg, & French, 2009). It is important to adjust the load and/or rest periods to assure that exercise technique is not compromised.\\n\\nHYPERTROPHY Muscle hypertrophy refers to an increase in cross-sectional area (CSA) brought about from a net increase or growth of the contractile proteins actin and myosin (myofibrillar hypertrophy), as well as glycogen and intracellular fluids (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy). To accomplish this increase in CSA, the hypertrophy phase combines moderate loads, repetitions, and rest intervals to elicit muscular tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage, all of which act as stimuli for adaptations. This combination of moderate loads, higher relative volume, and rest intervals can also cause an increase in circulating testosterone and growth hormones, which lead to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein degradation (Schoenfeld, 2010).\\n\\nHypertrophy training is often performed in body part “splits” or upper/lower body alternating routines, whereby exercises that focus on the upper body are performed on one day and exercises for the lower body the next day. Typical splits include chest, shoulders, and triceps; back and biceps; and legs. Other programming techniques used for hypertrophy may include forced reps, drop sets, supersets, compound sets, and heavy negatives.\\n\\n18\\n\\nRegardless of the method employed, the goal of hypertrophy workouts is to induce metabolic stress, muscle tension, and appropriate levels of muscle damage.', 'EXERCISE\\n\\nMUSCLES WORKED\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nREPS/TIME\\n\\nREST\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\nA1 B1\\n\\nJoint Mobility Warm-Up\\n\\nWhole Body\\n\\n1\\n\\n5-10 min\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nUse video or your own dynamic warm up.\\n\\nA1\\n\\nJump Squats\\n\\nQuads, Glutes, Hamstrings\\n\\n4\\n\\n8 reps\\n\\n30 sec\\n\\nLand softly.

This has led to the suggestion that machine exercises are safer and easier to learn initially, while free weights stress total muscular development to a larger degree. Due to specificity of training, free-weight training leads to greater improvements in free-weight tests and machine training results in greater performance on machine tests (6). When a neutral testing device is used, strength improvement from free weights and machines appear to produce similar results (38). Free weight training appears more applicable to improving athletic performance.\\n\\nHowever, some machines enable the performance of exercises that would be very difficult to perform with free weights (e.g., leg curls, lat pulldowns, tricep pushdowns).

These exercises can increase the activity of trunk muscles and other stabilizer muscles (compared to stable environments). However, since lighter weights must be lifted, the stimulus for maximal strength enhancement and force production is limited. In addition, recent research has indicated that structural movements, such as the squat and power clean exercise, are more effective than exercise on unstable surfaces in activating core muscle groups such as the trunk (23). There still may be some usefulness of exercises performed on unstable surfaces (i.e., rehabilitation). Chapter 10 discusses this in further detail. Strongman competition exercises have also become a popular method of training for many diverse populations. Exercises such as stone or barrel lifting, farmer’s walk, log press, tire lifting, and truck towing (to name a few) stress all major muscle groups and produce a high level of neuromuscular and metabolic challenge, creating a beneficial stimulus for total body strength and conditioning. Lastly, exercises can be performed with alternative equipment, such as sandbags, kegs, kettle bells, bands and chains (which provide variable resistance to full exercise range of motion), and thick bars.

Not only is there a huge genetic component to the amount of muscle damage a client experiences, but also to how efficiently the client recovers (3).\\n\\n4. LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Day 1 – Upper Body (Machine & Dumbbell Focus)\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Bench Press | 4 | 8–12 | Focus on controlled movement, targets chest and triceps |\\n| Machine Lat Pulldown | 4 | 8–12 | Use neutral grip if available, targets back |\\n| Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 8–12 | Keep core engaged, shoulder health |\\n| Machine Seated Row | 3 | 8–12 | Squeeze back muscles at the top |\\n| Dumbbell Bicep Curl | 3 | 10–15 | Use full range, avoid swinging |\\n| Tricep Pushdown (cable) | 3 | 10–15 | Maintain steady tension, targets triceps |\\n\\n### Day 2 – Lower Body (Machine & Dumbbell Focus)\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Goblet Squat | 4 | 8–12 | Keep chest up, knees tracking toes |\\n| Leg Press Machine | 4 | 8–12 | Focus on full range, avoid lockout |\\n| Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift | 3 | 8–12 | Hip hinge movement, hamstring focus |\\n| Seated Calf Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Full extension and contraction |\\n| Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Focus on slow reps for better engagement |\\n\\n### Day 3 – Upper Body (Dumbbells & Cable Machines)\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Incline Bench Press | 4 | 8–12 | Targets upper chest, control the descent |\\n| Cable Face Pull | 3 | 10–15 | Improve shoulder health, rear delts |\\n| Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Keep movement strict, isolate lateral delts |\\n| Dumbbell One-Arm Row | 3 | 8–12 | Focus on squeezing back, minimal momentum |\\n| Dumbbell Hammer Curl | 3 | 10–15 | Biceps and forearms, neutral grip |\\n| Overhead Dumbbell Triceps Extension | 3 | 10–15 | Focus on triceps stretch and activation |\\n\\n### Day 4 – Lower Body & Core\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Dumbbell Step-Ups | 4 | 8–12 per leg | Focus on stability, targets glutes and quads |\\n| Machine Leg Curl | 4 | 8–12 | Hamstring focus, control speed |\\n| Dumbbell Walking Lunges | 3 | 10–12 per leg | Maintain upright posture, engage glutes |\\n| Plank | 3 | 30–45s | Keep core tight, shoulder over elbows |\\n| Russian Twists (with dumbbell) | 3 | 20 | Rotate through full range, target obliques |\\n| Bicycle Crunches | 3 | 20 | Full range, engage abs |\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- Rest 60–90 seconds between sets.\\n- Focus on progressive overload—gradually increase weight when reps become easier.\\n- Maintain proper form and controlled movement for safety and effectiveness.\\n- Aim for consistency to build strength and muscle mass over time.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 731, 'prompt_tokens': 2423, 'total_tokens': 3154, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c1c09c31-c920-462f-a2de-8d97638890c0-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2423, 'output_tokens': 731, 'total_tokens': 3154, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

It is not meant to replace individualized training, nor is it a “cookie-cutter,” one-size-fits- all program. It is meant to serve as a resource and educational tool for personal trainers to design training programs quickly and effectively, which are progressive in nature and specific to the needs and goals of their clients.\\n\\nThe FFP provides supporting rationale and scientific references for the recommendations made, and these references can be found in the appendix.

As the worldwide authority on strength and conditioning, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) supports and disseminates research-based knowledge and its practical application to improve performance and fitness. Since the practical application often provides the greatest challenge to novice personal trainers, the FFP was developed to bridge that gap, helping personal trainers\\n\\n6\\n\\nefficiently and effectively design training programs based on scientific principles, specific to the individual needs of their clients.\\n\\nassessment, and then updated every 4 – 6 weeks of training. The following steps identify a systematic process used to develop the training program:\\n\\nPersonal training is often referred to as an art form (i.e., the art of applying research-based knowledge to individual situations including, but not limited to, a client’s goals, current/previous injuries, health and fitness status, level of physical competency, self-efficacy, self-confidence, etc.). While there are general training principles that apply to everyone, there are a number of factors that affect program design and client motivation. Regardless, programs should adhere to the principles put forth by the NSCA. These principles (Haff G. H., 2012) are:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSpecificity (individuality) Designing training programs/workouts with a specific goal in mind based on each client’s individual needs. Specificity in training can be accomplished by targeting muscle groups, energy systems, speed of movement, movement patterns, and/or muscle action types (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\n1. Consultation and Discussion of Goals\\n\\nThe initial consultation is an opportunity for the personal trainer to establish professional credibility, determine client-trainer compatibility, and develop rapport and trust with the client. A personal trainer establishes credibility by “debunking” fitness myths and explaining the scientific rationale and programming necessary to reach their goals. Rapport and trust are developed when the personal trainer asks the “right” questions and demonstrates active listening to the client’s responses; thereby, increasing the likelihood that a client will discuss the underlying motivational factors driving them to achieve their goals. These factors lay the foundation for open communication between the personal trainer and client, and increase the likelihood that their goals will be attained.\\n\\n2. Overload\\n\\nThe training stress (based on frequency, intensity, and type of exercise as well as recovery processes) placed on a client should exceed the training stress experienced during the previous workout. This is accomplished by increasing the load, sets, reps, or by decreasing the rest periods.\\n\\n3.

Regardless of the type selected, the overall purpose remains the same: to prepare the body for the demands of the upcoming workout, in particular to increase temperature-dependent physiological responses. These responses:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nincrease muscle temperature causing more forceful contractions and quicker relaxations,\\n\\n2.\\n\\nincrease blood temperature to working muscles, unloading more oxygen to working muscles, and\\n\\n3.\\n\\nincrease range of motion around joints (Hedrick, 2012).\\n\\nIt is important to note that dynamic warm-up/stretching is not the same as flexibility (e.g., static stretching) training. Flexibility refers to the range of motion at a specific joint or series of joints, and is typically assessed in non-weight bearing situations. Conversely, dynamic stretching refers to performing movements specific to a sport or movement pattern (Hedrick, 2012). Within the context of dynamic stretching are the terms mobility and movement preparation (prep). Mobility refers to a client’s ability to achieve a posture or position, is more global in nature, and emphasizes multi-joint movements and stabilization (Brooks & Cressey, 2013). Movement prep is an even broader term used to describe all of the various methods used to improve mobility during a warm-up. Performing a dynamic-based warm-up prior to physical activity appears to improve performance and may provide increased resistance to muscle injury (Hedrick, 2012).\\n\\n11\\n\\nDYNAMIC WARM-UP RECOMMENDATIONS A dynamic warm-up routine starts with about 5 min of cardiovascular activity, starting at a low intensity and progressing to a moderate intensity (i.e., to the point of developing a light sweat). This cardiovascular warm-up is followed by 5 – 15 min of movement prep that progresses from general exercises to ones that are more specific. Each movement prep exercise is performed for approximately 20 – 25 yards, or 5 – 10 reps. A list of dynamic warm-up exercises can be found in Appendix B; the exercises listed are linked to videos that provide exercise technique tips and coaching cues.\\n\\nConsider the following warm-up example for a client with limited mobility who will be performing the barbell back squat in the upcoming workout. After a 5-min warm-up (walk to jog to run), a sample mobility routine may include the following:', 'Workout Sessions\\n\\n12\\n\\nBefore the onset of any workout, the strength and conditioning professional must lead or direct a structured warm-up routine to prepare athletes for the subsequent workout. Proper warm-up routines can also reduce the risk for injury during training sessions. Whether the use of static stretching exercises should be incorporated into the warm-up is questionable (see chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion). A dynamic warm-up that utilizes exercise-specific movement patterns likely provides the greatest benefit in preparing for the workout. It is important to note that the warm-up should not fatigue athletes for subsequent performance. An example of a dynamic warm-up is shown in the following sidebar.\\n\\nAs athletes move from one training phase to another, it is imperative that they be physically ready for each proceeding step. The variables of intensity, volume, and exercise selection should progress to provide physical challenges in each subsequent training phase. Emphasis on proper technique should always be a priority. Load should not be emphasized until athletes have demonstrated successful technique in the exercise. The order of exercises within a training session is another variable that can be manipulated for better training results. Refer to chapter 4 for more specific guidelines on the development of the resistance training program, including guidelines for exercise order.', 'Human Kinetics; 2006.\\n\\nDynamic Warm-Up\\n\\nAvery D. Faigenbaum, EdD, CSCS*D, FNSCA, FACSM\\n\\nIt is important for all athletes to warm up before practice and competition. A well- designed warm-up can mentally and physically prepare athletes for the demands of sports training and athletic events by increasing blood flow to active muscles, raising core body temperature, enhancing metabolic reactions, and improving joint range of motion (26). These effects can boost athletic performance by enhancing oxygen delivery, increasing the speed of nerve-impulse transmissions, improving rate of force development, and maximizing strength and power (2, 5, 45). Moreover, a well-designed warm-up can set the tone for upcoming activities and establish a desired tempo for practice or competition. Indeed, warm-up procedures that are consistent with the needs, goals, and abilities of each athlete should be considered an integral component of every sport practice and competition.\\n\\nAlthough well-designed warm-up procedures can enhance athletic performance, reduce the risk of injury, and lessen the potential for muscle soreness after exercise (1, 21, 26), it is important to realize that warming up and stretching are two different activities. A warm-up consists of preparatory activities and functionally based movements that are specifically designed to prepare the body for exercise or sport. In contrast, the primary goal of stretching is to enhance flexibility. These distinctions are important because long-held beliefs about traditional warm-up procedures have recently been questioned. Some scientists and practitioners now propose that it may be advantageous to exclude static stretching from warm-up routines prior to sport training and athletic competitions (32, 49, 52, 59).\\n\\nInterest is growing in warm-up procedures that involve dynamic activities and sport-specific movements that maximize active ranges of motion at different movement-specific speeds while preparing the body for the demands of sport training and competition (10, 13, 15, 29, 55). This chapter reviews the components of a traditional warm-up and examines the potential benefits of a dynamic warm-up. Although it discusses different types of warm-ups, this chapter focuses on the influence of dynamic warm-up protocols on athletic performance. It also discusses the proposed physiological mechanisms that may enhance the preparedness of athletes for sport practice and competition and outlines program design considerations for developing warm-up protocols that emphasize the movement requirements of the sport or activity.\\n\\n3\\n\\nA traditional warm-up usually consists of two components. The first is a general warm-up of 5 to 10 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise, such as jogging or stationary cycling, followed by several minutes of static stretching. The second is a specific warm-up that involves less intense movements similar to the sport or activity about to be performed. The purpose of this type of warm-up is to allow the body to gradually adjust to the changing physiological demands of the exercise session without undue fatigue. A general warm-up of basic exercises for the major muscle groups increases heart rate, blood flow, muscle temperature, and core body temperature, as evidenced by the onset of sweating. Static stretching exercises, in which a body position is held stationary for time (typically 10-30 seconds), are habitually a predetermined period of recommended by some sport coaches to improve range of motion within joints, enhance performance, and reduce the risk of injury prior to activity (30, 36, 46). However, conventional beliefs regarding the routine practice of pre-event static stretching have recently been questioned (48, 50, 53).', 'Figure 2-3. Repetition Ranges for Specific Training Outcomes\\n\\nsprint drills, bounding activities, or jumping, follow the dynamic stretching. The more power necessary for the sport or activity, the more important the warm-up becomes. Including high-intensity dynamic exercises can facilitate subsequent performance. This phase should also include rehearsal of the skills to be performed.\\n\\nA warm-up should progress gradually and provide sufficient intensity to increase muscle and core temperatures without causing fatigue or reducing energy stores. It is likely that there are optimal levels of warm-ups related to the specific sport, the athlete, and the environment, so no one warm-up routine is best for every athlete, or sport.\\n\\nStretching During Warm-Up There are four main types of stretching: static, ballistic, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). Static stretching has long been used in a warm-up, with the aim of enhancing performance. However, recent reviews of the literature surrounding the role of static stretching question this practice (51,52). There is little, if any, evidence that stretching pre- or post-participation prevents injury or subsequent muscle soreness (32,34,46,48,51,52). Although static stretching before activity may increase performance in sports that require an increased range of motion, such as gymnastics, stretching activities may or may not influence subsequent strength, power, running speed, reaction time, and strength endurance performance, and often depends on what intermittent activity was used between the stretching and the strength activity (11,12,13,19,20,36,40,41,44,48,54,55,56). In these cases it is important that the strength training and conditioning professional performs a benefit–risk analysis when choosing whether or not to include static stretching in a warm-up (38).\\n\\nDynamic stretching, which is functionally based and sues sport- specific movements to prepare for activity, does not seem to elicit the performance reduction effects of static and PNF stretching, but has been shown to improve subsequent running performance (27,60,61). Given these findings, the use of static, PNF, and ballistic stretching in a warm-up needs to be questioned. Based on current evidence, dynamic stretching is the preferred option for stretching during a warm-up.\\n\\nThe degree of stretching required in a warm-up depends on the type of sport. Sports that require increased flexibility, such as gymnastics or diving, require a greater degree of stretching (52). Additionally, those sports with high demands for a stretch- shortening cycle of high-intensity, as in sprinting and American football, are likely to require more stretching than those with low or medium stretch-shortening cycle activity, as in jogging or cycling (59). Strength training and conditioning professionals should look at the specific range of motion and stretch-shortening cycle requirements of the sport or activity and use this information to design an appropriate warm-up routine.\\n\\nConclusion Program design must take into account many factors related to the life and training of each athlete. Program design is guided by theory and hands-on experience from many previous and current coaches and sport scientists. The following provides a 12-week strength and conditioning program as an example of how to develop and implement the lessons presented throughout this manual.\\n\\n17\\n\\nBasics of Strength and Conditioning\\n\\n18\\n\\nBasics of Strength and Conditioning', 'Developing a Dynamic Warm-Up Protocol\\n\\nUnlike a traditional warm-up protocol, a dynamic warm-up can result in noticeable improvements in fundamental movement skills. It also prepares the body for the vigorous, random movements training and competition. As such, this phase of training can provide an opportunity for younger athletes to gain confidence in their abilities to perform movement skills. Additionally, warm-up activities that are active, engaging, and somewhat challenging are far more enjoyable than traditional stretch-and-hold activities.\\n\\nthat can occur during sports\\n\\nA well-designed dynamic warm-up should turn on the neuromuscular system to prepare athletes for the demands of sports training and competition. The general idea is to (1) warm up, (2) activate, and (3) motivate. Warm up highlights the importance of increasing body temperature, activate refers to exciting or potentiating the neuromuscular system, and motivate draws attention to the need to psychologically prepare athletes for the demands of sports practice and competition. Instead of jogging around the playing field, a general warm-up of jumping rope, body-weight calisthenics, medicine ball exercises, footwork patterns with an agility ladder, or sport-specific actions, such as dribbling a soccer ball around cones, can contribute to movement skill development and make a valuable contribution to the overall conditioning process. In one study, the incorporation of a four-week dynamic warm-up into the daily preseason training regimen of college wrestlers positively influenced measures of strength, power, agility, muscular endurance, and flexibility as compared to an active control condition (25).\\n\\nFor a sample dynamic warm-up protocol, see chapter 12.\\n\\nA fundamental principle of a dynamic warm-up is to perform large muscle group exercises that are similar to the movement patterns that will be performed during training or competition. Dynamic warm-up routines do not require equipment or a lot of space. Athletes typically perform each functionally based movement in place for a prescribed number of repetitions (e.g., 8 to 12) or cover a predetermined distance (e.g., 10 to 20 m). Normally, athletes complete 8 to 12 different exercises that progress from relatively simple movements to more challenging exercises, involving more complex movement patterns that require greater ranges of motion. To this end, a well-designed warm-up can enhance the physical fitness of athletes and contribute to the overall conditioning program in a time-efficient manner. However, it is important to keep in mind that the goal is to warm up, activate, and motivate without undue fatigue. Performance may deteriorate if the warm-up is too intense or if the muscles do not have an opportunity to recover from the fatigue induced during the pre-event dynamic warm-up protocol.\\n\\nIf appropriate, dynamic exercises can be combined to add variety to the warm-up routine in a time-efficient manner. For example, knee lifts can be added to the lunge walk to stretch more muscles in a shorter period of time. In any case, athletes should perform each movement while receiving instruction on correct exercise technique (e.g., vertical torso, up on toes, knee toward chest) in order to reinforce proper movement mechanics. Since literally hundreds of exercises can be incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, the sample exercises described in this chapter should be considered a general guide or starting point to help strength and conditioning professionals develop a 10- to 15-minute routine that is consistent with the fitness\\n\\nand skill level of their athletes.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Day 1 – Warm-up for General Fitness\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Jumping jacks | – | 30–45s | Increases whole-body blood flow and warms muscles |\\n| Body-weight squats | – | 10–15 reps | Activates lower body, targets glutes and thighs |\\n| High knees | – | 30–45s | Raises heart rate, boosts hip mobility |\\n| Arm circles | – | 15 each direction | Loosens shoulder joints, enhances mobility |\\n| Lunges with torso twist | – | 8–10 each leg | Engages glutes, hip flexors, improves core and hip mobility |\\n| Leg swings (front & side) | – | 10 each leg | Dynamic stretching for hips and hamstrings |\\n| Push-up to downward dog | – | 8–10 reps | Warms upper body, stretches shoulders and back |\\n| Gentle jogging in place | – | 2 min | Maintains warm-up tempo, prepares cardiovascular system |\\n\\nThis routine leverages dynamic movements to increase body temperature, upgrade joint mobility, and activate muscles—all essential for safe, effective workouts.

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Typically, jump squats (i.e., CMJ performed with a bar loaded to a percentage of body weight or 1RM and held across the shoulders) are the primary ballistic resistance training exercises used to improve muscular power in the lower body. For the upper body, bench press throws are particularly effective for boxers or football players who require high force to punch or fend off an opponent. These are performed like a normal bench press, but the bar is thrown and then caught. For the shot put, athletes can use an inclined bench and adjust the angle so that the throw is in the same plane as their put. Pulling movements can also be performed ballistically, with the athlete lying on a bench and pulling the bar rapidly upward. A rubber stopper or foam dampener is required to soften the impact with the bench. Specifically designed equipment is available for ballistic resistance training. Due to considerations of specificity, free-weight bars are being used more frequently with a special power cage that provides bottom stops in case of a missed catch or bungled jump. The equipment may also incorporate braking systems to limit impact forces and instrumentation to record force, power, and velocity of the movements.', 'The National Strength and Conditioning Association’s (NSCA) BASICS OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING MANUAL Dr. William A.

Training volume can be manipulated by changing the number of exercises performed per session, the number of repetitions performed per set, or the number of sets per exercise. Typically, an inverse relationship exists between the number of sets per exercise and the number of exercises performed in a workout. There is also an inverse relationship between volume and intensity. That is, volume should be reduced if significant increases in intensity are prescribed. Strength training is associated with low to moderate training volume, since a low to moderate number of repetitions are performed per set for core structural exercises. Hypertrophy and muscular endurance training are associated with moderate to high intensity and volume. These programs, which are high in total work, tend to stimulate a potent endocrine and metabolic response.\\n\\nTraining volumes of athletes vary considerably and depend on other factors besides intensity (e.g., training status, number of muscle groups trained per workout, nutrition practices, practice and competition schedule). Current volume recommendations for strength training include one to three sets per exercise for novice lifters and two to six sets for intermediate and advanced lifters. Multiple sets should be used with systematic variation of volume and intensity for progression into intermediate and advanced training. Dramatic increases in volume are not recommended, since they may lead to overtraining. Further, not all exercises need to be performed with the same number of sets. The volume of each exercise is related to the program priorities (31).\\n\\nThe number of sets performed per exercise, muscle group worked, and overall structure of the workout is also of primary interest when designing a resistance training program. Few studies directly compare resistance training programs of varying total sets. Most volume studies compare single- and multiple-set training programs. One set of an exercise performed for 8 to 12 repetitions at an intentionally slow lifting velocity has been compared to both periodized and nonperiodized multiple-set programs. These studies have shown similar results in novice athletes regardless of program design (37), but some studies have shown multiple sets to be superior (5). Periodized, multiple-set programs were shown to be superior during progression to intermediate and advanced stages of training (20, 22, 32). One study showed strength reduction in trained women who switched to a\\n\\nsingle-set program (18). Regarding total sets per workout, one study that examined the current literature suggested that eight sets per muscle group yielded the most substantial effects (28). Most studies used two to six sets per exercise and found substantial strength increases in trained and untrained athletes (21). Typically, two to six sets per exercise are most common during resistance training, but both greater and lesser amounts have also been used successfully.', 'In general, the ideal training program has athletes perform plyometric exercises on the days for upper body resistance training. If upper body plyometric exercises are to be included, they should be performed on days for lower body resistance training. A sample training program for integrating both strength and plyometric training can be seen in table 12.6. It is also possible to include several lower body plyometric exercises as part of the lower body resistance training program. However, the strength and conditioning professional should be careful to not fatigue the athlete. As different modes of exercise are added, to reduce the incidence of overreaching, it would be prudent to reduce the volume of training for other exercises. For instance, if a few plyometric exercises are included on days for a lower body lifting routine, a few of the lower body assistance exercises should be removed. Using the training program described in table 12.4, the strength and conditioning professional can substitute box jumps for deadlifts on one of the lower body lifting days to avoid overtraining the athlete.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Day 1 – Bench Press Focus\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Bench Press | 4 | 8–10 | primary movement, focus on progressive overload |\\n| Incline Dumbbell Press | 3 | 10–12 | targets upper chest, supports bench strength |\\n| Bent-over Rows | 3 | 10–12 | complements pressing, enhances back strength |\\n| Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 10–12 | overhead pressing for shoulder stability |\\n| Tricep Dips (Assisted if needed) | 3 | 12–15 | triceps development for lockout strength |\\n\\n### Day 2 – Upper Body Hypertrophy\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Flat Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 | 10–12 | alternative pressing variation |\\n| Pull-ups or Lat Pulldown | 3 | 8–10 | back and biceps, balancing push movements |\\n| Dumbbell Lateral Raises | 3 | 12–15 | shoulder isolation, improves stability |\\n| Cable Tricep Pushdowns | 3 | 12–15 | accessory for tricep strength |\\n| Plank | 3 | 30–45s | core stability support |\\n\\n### Day 3 – Strength & Power\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Bench Press (Heavy Day) | 4 | 6–8 | focus on increasing load steadily |\\n| Overhead Barbell Press | 3 | 8–10 | overhead strength, supports bench press |\\n| Dumbbell Rows | 3 | 10–12 | endurance and back involvement |\\n| Close-Grip Bench Press | 3 | 8–10 | tricep focus, good for lockout strength |\\n| Push-up (Weighted or Elevate) | 3 | 12–15 | supplemental chest activation |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 431, 'prompt_tokens': 2196, 'total_tokens': 2627, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-0a5e93ee-6ece-45f6-b989-108608ec64d3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2196, 'output_tokens': 431, 'total_tokens': 2627, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

Subsequent sets of a given exercise must begin before complete recovery has been reached, which causes increased metabolic stress (Buresh, Berg, & French, 2009). It is important to adjust the load and/or rest periods to assure that exercise technique is not compromised.\\n\\nHYPERTROPHY Muscle hypertrophy refers to an increase in cross-sectional area (CSA) brought about from a net increase or growth of the contractile proteins actin and myosin (myofibrillar hypertrophy), as well as glycogen and intracellular fluids (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy). To accomplish this increase in CSA, the hypertrophy phase combines moderate loads, repetitions, and rest intervals to elicit muscular tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage, all of which act as stimuli for adaptations. This combination of moderate loads, higher relative volume, and rest intervals can also cause an increase in circulating testosterone and growth hormones, which lead to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein degradation (Schoenfeld, 2010).\\n\\nHypertrophy training is often performed in body part “splits” or upper/lower body alternating routines, whereby exercises that focus on the upper body are performed on one day and exercises for the lower body the next day. Typical splits include chest, shoulders, and triceps; back and biceps; and legs. Other programming techniques used for hypertrophy may include forced reps, drop sets, supersets, compound sets, and heavy negatives.\\n\\n18\\n\\nRegardless of the method employed, the goal of hypertrophy workouts is to induce metabolic stress, muscle tension, and appropriate levels of muscle damage.', 'HYPERTROPHY VARIABLES\\n\\nBEGINNER\\n\\nINTERMEDIATE ADVANCED\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, sequencing of training has a complementary effect. This means that initially increasing the CSA of muscle fibers may promote greater increases in strength with subsequent training. Similarly, the neural improvements that result from increasing maximum strength may improve the hypertrophic effect (Haff G.

Malek (eds.), 2012, NSCA’s\\n\\nExisting strength training guidelines suggest that primary exercises (complex multi-joint movements) be performed first, followed by assistance exercises (smaller muscles/muscle groups and single-joint movements). Standard exercise order seems to be the most effective for optimal strength gains because it allows greater recovery between sets compared to muscular endurance or hypertrophy training. Max strength training is typically performed by movement groups (as opposed to training individual body parts), such as push (e.g., squat, lunge, bench press, etc.), pull (e.g., deadlift, bent-over row, etc.), and press (e.g., military press, etc.). Clients with more experience who are more advanced may further break down the movements into lower-body push, lower-body pull, upper-body push, upper-body pull, and press (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\nessentials of personal training, 2nd ed.

The muscular strength phase employs heavy loads (e.g., 1 – 6RM) and longer rest periods to increase the maximal level of force a muscle (or group of muscles) can generate, regardless of time.\\n\\nAn example strength workout might include 1 – 3 strength exercises, such as the back squat and bench press (3 – 6 sets of 3 – 6 reps with 3 min of rest) followed by assistance/complementary movements using hypertrophy variables, such as walking lunges, leg extensions, dumbbell flies, and triceps extensions (3 sets of 8 – 12 reps with 1 min of rest).\\n\\nOther program design techniques commonly used to increase maximum strength include cluster sets, the use of accommodating resistance, partial range of motion, and isometric work (Schoenfeld, 2011).', 'PROGRAM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR OPTIMAL STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY OF THE GLUTE MUSCLES\\n\\nASHLEY HODGE, MBA, CSCS\\n\\nIncreasing glute strength can likely improve many performance-\\n\\nbased actions, including sprinting, jumping, cutting, and rotating due to the glutes’ triplanar role as hip extensors, hip abductors, and hip external rotators. While there is no best scientifically-proven way to periodize a program, there are many methods that a personal trainer can employ to successfully build stronger glutes in their clients. This article provides eight considerations when designing a program to optimally build the glutes.\\n\\nLATERAL/ROTARY GLUTE EXERCISES Lateral/rotary glute exercises movements (e.g., lateral band walks, cable chop and lift variations, machine and band seated hip abduction) train the glute medius in the frontal and transverse plane while involving shorter muscle lengths. In other words, these exercises tend not to involve much of a stretch on the glutes because they work through a small range of motion and do not stress in the lengthened position. These movements are great for producing a burn, which provides metabolic stress. Thus, these exercises are less likely to cause overall fatigue and soreness.\\n\\n1. EXERCISE SELECTION Compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, lunges, hip thrusts, and glute bridges can be used as staples in a glute training program because these exercises target multiple muscle groups, including the glutes, while allowing for heavier loads to be lifted, which can result in greater muscle growth. A study conducted by Santos et al. found that the addition of barbell hip thrusts to resistance training is effective in significantly increasing gluteus maximus muscle hypertrophy (10). This study compared the effects of performing 45-degree leg presses and stiff-leg deadlifts versus performing 45-degree leg presses, stiff-leg deadlifts, and barbell hip thrusts on gluteus maximus muscle size on 33 untrained young women (10). Over the 10-week training period, there was a notable difference in muscle size growth with the addition of the barbell hip thrust (10). Different exercises load the glutes in different directions, which relates to body positioning and the ways in which the resistance is affecting it. Therefore, the author recommends to include the following types of glute exercises:\\n\\nThe frontal plane will target the glute medius more while the transverse plane will also incorporate some glute maximus muscle fibers (3). In addition to incorporating exercises from all three categories, the author also recommends employing exercise variety and choosing exercises that suit the individual client’s anatomy the best. Using the mind-muscle connection model, personal trainers should have their client think about the muscle that is being worked and experiment with different stances, ranges of motion, postures, and pelvic positions to determine which gives them the most glute activation (3).\\n\\nPRACTICAL PROGRAM DESIGN FOR GLUTE DEVELOPMENT The following four movement patterns are recommended to focus on during training session to maximize glute development (3):\\n\\n1. Thrust/Bridge: These are hip thrust, glute bridge, and frog pump patterns. These movements target the lower and upper glutes.\\n\\nHORIZONTAL HIP EXTENSION EXERCISES These movements will train the upper and lower subdivisions of the glute maximus in the shortened position, which is at the top when locked out (e.g., hip thrusts, frog pumps, back extensions, kickbacks, glute bridges). These exercises should not result in as much fatigue or soreness because they train the glutes at short muscle lengths (2).\\n\\n2.

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Typically, jump squats (i.e., CMJ performed with a bar loaded to a percentage of body weight or 1RM and held across the shoulders) are the primary ballistic resistance training exercises used to improve muscular power in the lower body. For the upper body, bench press throws are particularly effective for boxers or football players who require high force to punch or fend off an opponent. These are performed like a normal bench press, but the bar is thrown and then caught. For the shot put, athletes can use an inclined bench and adjust the angle so that the throw is in the same plane as their put. Pulling movements can also be performed ballistically, with the athlete lying on a bench and pulling the bar rapidly upward. A rubber stopper or foam dampener is required to soften the impact with the bench. Specifically designed equipment is available for ballistic resistance training. Due to considerations of specificity, free-weight bars are being used more frequently with a special power cage that provides bottom stops in case of a missed catch or bungled jump. The equipment may also incorporate braking systems to limit impact forces and instrumentation to record force, power, and velocity of the movements.', 'Unfortunately, little research exists examining the efficacy of ballistic power training with heavy-load ballistic and weightlifting exercises. Tricoli and colleagues (97) reported that weightlifting training using four- to six-repetition maximum loads resulted in significant improvements in maximal jump height and 10 m sprint performance. However, this study involved relatively untrained subjects who also showed a significant improvement in 1RM following the training (97). McBride and colleagues (76) observed improvements in peak power during 55% and 80% 1RM jump squats, but not during a 30% 1RM jump squat following eight weeks of ballistic jump squat training with 80% 1RM. These improvements were associated with improved muscle activity of the vastus lateralis during the 55% and 80% 1RM jump squats, suggesting load- or velocity-specific adaptations (76). Although more research is required to elucidate the effect of heavy-load ballistic and weightlifting training on power production and the mechanisms responsible for performance improvements, such training is theorized to be ideal for athletes required to generate high power outputs against heavy loads (i.e., wrestlers, rugby union front rowers, American football linemen).', 'SUMMARY POINTS\\n\\nManipulation of the acute resistance training variables is critical to program design. The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25). Individualized training programs must to maximize performance enhancement.', 'Lifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Rack Shrug OR Rack Jump OR Rack Clean\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB High Pull\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB Standing Shoulder Press OR DB Shoulder Raises\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nPulling Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nBicep Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nAb Planks\\n\\n2x 15-30 seconds\\n\\n3x 15-30 seconds\\n\\n3x 30-45 seconds\\n\\n3x 30-45 seconds\\n\\nFriday - Strength\\n\\nWeek 1 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 2 - 70%\\n\\nWeek 3 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 4 - 75%\\n\\nLifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Back Squat OR Modified Squat\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nBB Romanian Deadlift (RDL)\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nSingle Leg Choice\\n\\n2x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\nBB Bench Press\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nTriceps Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nAB Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nKey\\n\\nComments/Notes\\n\\nBB - Barbell / DB - Dumbbell\\n\\nCB - Cable / MB - Medicine Ball\\n\\n20\\n\\nStrength Phase\\n\\nBasics of Strength and Conditioning - Twelve Week Program\\n\\nMonday - Explosive\\n\\nWeek 5 - 75%\\n\\nWeek 6 - 80%\\n\\nWeek 7 - 75%\\n\\nWeek 8 - 85%\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nUnload\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nLifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Hang Shrug OR Hang Jump OR Hang Clean\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5', 'THEME\\n\\nFOCUS\\n\\nREPS\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nTOTAL VOLUME\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nRECOVERY\\n\\nWeek 1\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 2\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 3\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:1\\n\\n1:30\\n\\nWeek 4\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n20\\n\\nWeek 5\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 6\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 7\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n14\\n\\n4\\n\\n56\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nWeek 8\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n25\\n\\nWeek 9\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nSTRENGTH TRAINING FOR THE OLDER CLIENT—A BLUEPRINT\\n\\nWeek 10\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nFOR PROGRAM DESIGN\\n\\nWeek 11\\n\\nCardiovascular endurance\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n1:1\\n\\nReady go\\n\\nWeek 12\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n30'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Monday – Chest Focus\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Bench Press | 4 | 6–8 | Progressive overload for strength gains |\\n| Dumbbell Incline Bench Press | 3 | 8–10 | Targets upper chest, enhances stretch |\\n| Cable Crossover | 3 | 12–15 | Focus on peak contraction, high reps |\\n| Dumbbell Pullover | 3 | 10–12 | Expand rib cage, target chest and lats |\\n| Chest Dips | 3 | AMAP | Lean forward for chest emphasis |\\n\\n### Wednesday – Chest Hypertrophy & Power\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Bench Press (Pause reps, explosive) | 4 | 3–5 | Builds power, breaks plateaus |\\n| Incline Dumbbell Press | 3 | 8–10 | Emphasize upper chest development |\\n| Cable Crossover (Low to high) | 3 | 12–15 | Stretch & contraction, high rep pump |\\n| Overhead Dumbbell Extension | 3 | 10–12 | Triceps assist, lockout strength |\\n| Push-ups (Weighted or Plyometric) | 2 | AMAP | Explosive, muscular endurance |\\n\\n### Friday – Volume & Pump\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Decline Barbell Bench Press | 4 | 8–10 | Focus on lower chest thickness |\\n| Flat Dumbbell Bench Press | 4 | 8–10 | Balances bilateral strength |\\n| Pec Deck Machine | 3 | 15–20 | Constant tension, hypertrophy focus |\\n| Dumbbell Flyes | 3 | 12–15 | Stretching, muscle isolation |\\n| Triceps Pushdowns | 3 | 12–15 | Supports pressing power |\\n\\n*Notes:* Incorporate bench press variations, controlled eccentric phases, and pause reps to overcome strength plateaus.

Muscle-strengthening activities can also\\n\\nhelp maintain muscle mass during weight loss.\\n\\nMuscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work\\n\\nthan they are accustomed to doing. That is, they overload\\n\\nthe muscles. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities\\n\\ninclude lifting weights, working with resistance bands, doing\\n\\ncalisthenics that use body weight for resistance (such as\\n\\npush-ups, pull-ups, and planks), carrying heavy loads, and\\n\\nheavy gardening.\\n\\nMuscle-strengthening activities count if they involve a\\n\\nmoderate or greater level of intensity or effort and work\\n\\nthe major muscle groups of the body—the legs, hips, back,\\n\\nchest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. Muscle-strengthening\\n\\nactivities for all the major muscle groups should be done at least 2 days a week. The improvement in, or\\n\\nmaintenance of, muscle strength is specific to the muscles used during the activity, so a variety of activities is\\n\\nnecessary to achieve balanced muscle strength.\\n\\nNo specific amount of time is recommended for muscle strengthening, but muscle-strengthening exercises\\n\\nshould be performed to the point at which it would be difficult to do another repetition. When resistance\\n\\ntraining is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise is effective, although\\n\\n2 or 3 sets may be more effective.

Clients should time meals and snacks with whole foods around training to meet these recommendations.\\n\\nCOMMON MYTH: “BULKING” AND THE “PUMP” If a client (especially female) walks into a training session wanting to lose weight they may be skeptical of a personal trainer that recommends strength training, especially if they believe the “pump” experienced during workout will make them appear “bigger.” The “pump,” is cellular swelling caused by a temporary shift in blood caused by increased blood flow into the muscle and compression against the veins (Schoenfeld & Contreras, 2013). Oftentimes, this fear is reduced when personal trainers inform their clients that the “pump” is short lived (i.e., minutes to hours) and causes beneficial adaptations.\\n\\na. During caloric restriction, it is recommended to\\n\\nmaintain or increase daily protein intake (1.5 – 2.0 g/kg of bodyweight) and emphasize resistance training as this combination may attenuate or prevent the loss of fat-free mass and resting metabolic rate (Antonio & La Bounty, 2011).\\n\\nCONSTANT STATE OF FLUX Sport and exercise nutrition are ever-evolving fields. Personal trainers can stay engaged and informed with changes by visiting trusted websites (e.g., www.choosemyplate.gov, www.heart.org, or www.eatright.org) and reading research-based journals.\\n\\n3. Encourage clients to maintain a diet log for the\\n\\nprimary purpose of helping self-identify areas for improvement. For example, a client may not realize that they snack on a soft drink and cookie every afternoon until they write it down in a log repeatedly.\\n\\nMore information: 1. Campbell, B, Spano, M.

Recent research has examined high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which may provide similar reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors as those observed with continuous moderate- intensity physical activity. HIIT is a form of interval training that consists of alternating short periods of maximal-effort exercise with less intense recovery periods. This type of exercise can improve insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and body composition in adults. Interestingly, adults with overweight or obesity and those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes tend to have greater cardiovascular benefits when doing HIIT compared to normal-weight or healthy adults.\\n\\nWeight Management Physical activity and caloric intake both must be considered when trying to control body weight. Because of its role in energy balance, physical activity is a critical factor in determining whether a person can maintain a\\n\\nhealthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss.\\n\\nStrong scientific evidence shows that physical activity helps people maintain a stable weight over time and can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain and the incidence of obesity. People vary a great deal in how much physical activity they need to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Some need more physical activity than others to maintain a healthy body weight, to lose weight, or to keep weight off once it has been lost. Many people need more than the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to maintain their weight. The relationship between physical activity and prevention of weight gain is most often observed with moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Muscle-strengthening activities help promote weight maintenance, although not to the same degree as aerobic activity.\\n\\nPeople who want to lose a substantial amount of weight (more than 5 percent of body weight) and people who are trying to keep a significant amount of weight off once it has been lost may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to meet weight-control goals. Muscle-strengthening activities can also help maintain lean body mass during weight loss. Combining both caloric restriction and physical activity tend to be most beneficial for weight loss rather than just caloric restriction or just physical activity.\\n\\nPeople with overweight or obesity tend to experience the same benefits of physical activity as those with normal weight.

The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25). Individualized training programs must to maximize performance enhancement.', 'Muscular Strength\\n\\nStrength, the amount of force or torque a muscle can exert at a specified or determined velocity (65), varies for different muscle actions, such as eccentric, concentric, and isometric contractions (68). Often, strength and conditioning professionals and athletes associate the term strength with the force that can be exerted during slow-speed, or even isometric, muscle actions. This is often determined using a test of one-repetition maximum (1RM), in which strength is assessed as the maximum weight the athlete can lift once throughout the complete movement. The development and assessment of 1RM strength have received a great deal of research attention, and interested readers may refer to the relevant literature (2, 6, 45). When lifting a maximal weight, the limiting factor is muscle strength at slow contraction velocities. Muscle strength as required in 1RM lifts, however, is needed in a limited number of athletic endeavors (e.g., powerlifting). Most sports require high force output at much faster velocities of movement and the rapid attainment of high force from a relaxed state.\\n\\nResearch findings (22, 46, 101, 102) and anecdotal evidence from strength and conditioning professionals indicate that if an athlete’s strength at slow movement velocities increases, then power output and athletic performance also improve. This occurs since maximum strength, even at slow velocities, is a contributing factor in maximal power. In other words, a fundamental relationship exists between strength and power that dictates that an athlete cannot possess a high level of power without first being relatively strong. Research involving heavy strength training programs\\n\\nwith untrained to moderately trained subjects has demonstrated that such training results not only in improved maximal strength but also in increased maximal power output (22, 47, 62, 78, 93, 94, 101, 102). Although strength is a basic quality that influences maximal power production, the significance of this influence diminishes somewhat when the athlete maintains a very high level of strength (69). Despite this, the current strength level of athletes will always dictate the upper limit of their potential to generate maximal muscular power because the ability to generate force rapidly is of little benefit if maximal force is low.\\n\\nWhen attempting to maximize power output, the concentric phase follows the eccentric phase. As such, it starts from zero velocity. Therefore, the force produced during the latter part of the eccentric phase, the changeover from lengthening to shortening (which includes a phase when the muscle is contracting isometrically), and the subsequent concentric contraction is determined by the maximum strength isometric, and concentric of contractions. If maximal strength is increased, then higher forces can be exerted during this time, resulting in increased impulse, which leads to increased acceleration (22). However, as the muscles begin to achieve high velocities of shortening, strength capacity at slow movement velocity has a reduced impact on the ability of the muscle to produce high force (32, 61, 62). This fact becomes increasingly important as the athlete attempts to train specifically for maximal power development.\\n\\nthe agonist muscles during slow eccentric,', 'THEME\\n\\nFOCUS\\n\\nREPS\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nTOTAL VOLUME\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nRECOVERY\\n\\nWeek 1\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 2\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 3\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:1\\n\\n1:30\\n\\nWeek 4\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n20\\n\\nWeek 5\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 6\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 7\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n14\\n\\n4\\n\\n56\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nWeek 8\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n25\\n\\nWeek 9\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nSTRENGTH TRAINING FOR THE OLDER CLIENT—A BLUEPRINT\\n\\nWeek 10\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nFOR PROGRAM DESIGN\\n\\nWeek 11\\n\\nCardiovascular endurance\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n1:1\\n\\nReady go\\n\\nWeek 12\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n30', 'muscular fitness.

Look for opportunities to incorporate physical activity and exercise into your lifestyle as much as possible. Many employees who spend much of their day working on computers find it helpful to follow either a 25-5 or 50-10 strategy. The 25-5 or 50-10 strategy states that for every 25 (or 50) min of work, take a break of 5 (or 10) min to move around, stretch, relax, and refocus the mind. While this sounds counterintuitive to productivity, research suggests there are no adverse effects when breaks are relatively short (9). Additionally, active breaks with a change in posture may be effective in reducing pain and discomfort that is commonly associated with prolonged sitting (20). A higher quality and quantity of work may even be accomplished due to the increased focus and efficiency and decreased likelihood of distraction during the larger blocks of time.\\n\\nIt is recommended to form an activity plan at the beginning of each week or month. A key component is being able to execute the plan, so it depends on your individual capability to stay consistent. Set aside the days that you intend to exercise along with the days that you intend to rest and recover. Note that the health benefits of exercise will only be maximized if you balance the volume and intensity of your exercise with adequate amounts of rest and recovery (7). Also, set aside the time of day that you plan to exercise—morning, afternoon, evening, or night. This level of intentionality makes it more likely that you will follow through with action. There will certainly be days that you will not want to exercise, but making it part of your routine will help keep you consistent. Regular activity can increase energy during the day, improve sleep quality at night, help with stress management, improve emotional well-being, and enhance cognition (13).\\n\\nWORKOUT PARTNERS Although it may sound silly at first, one of the best ways for parents to get more physical activity throughout the day is to have children become workout partners. If workout equipment is available at home, kids can exercise alongside the parent. The children can do squats, overhead presses, and core exercises, or could climb around on a bench or power rack, hit a punching bag, swing from hanging rings, or make obstacle courses using dumbbells, barbells, and jump ropes while parents perform their workout. While the opportunities available to each family will be based on prioritizing the safety of everyone involved and the equipment present, such creative physical activity with children lets parents get their exercise while spending time with their kids and positively influencing their future fitness habits.\\n\\nInformally, you can play games with your children that involve actions such as running, climbing, throwing, or kicking. Such activities can range from organized sports to games that are\\n\\n6\\n\\nPTQ 11.2 | NSCA.COM Copyright National Strength and Conditioning Association 2024\\n\\nPTQ 11.2\\n\\nMAINTAINING HEALTH AND FITNESS IN PARENTHOOD—'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Week 1 – Rebuild Strength & Improve General Fitness\\n\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Bodyweight Squats | 3 | 10–12 | Focus on form, controlled movement |\\n| Incline Push-Ups | 3 | 8–10 | Use a sturdy surface, knees down if needed |\\n| Bent-Over Rows (with light weights or water bottles) | 3 | 12 | Keep back flat, squeeze back muscles |\\n| Glute Bridges | 3 | 12–15 | Lift hips to activate glutes, slow tempo |\\n| Plank (Knees or full) | 3 | 20–30 sec | Engage core, keep body straight |\\n| Standing March | 2 | 1 min | Gentle cardio, improve mobility |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 177, 'prompt_tokens': 2674, 'total_tokens': 2851, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c0f1d2b1-88aa-4e69-b4cb-9e0fc4d550b6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2674, 'output_tokens': 177, 'total_tokens': 2851, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

This means that initially increasing the CSA of muscle fibers may promote greater increases in strength with subsequent training.

Coburn and M.H. Malek (eds.), 2012, NSCA’s\\n\\nExisting strength training guidelines suggest that primary exercises (complex multi-joint movements) be performed first, followed by assistance exercises (smaller muscles/muscle groups and single-joint movements). Standard exercise order seems to be the most effective for optimal strength gains because it allows greater recovery between sets compared to muscular endurance or hypertrophy training. Max strength training is typically performed by movement groups (as opposed to training individual body parts), such as push (e.g., squat, lunge, bench press, etc.), pull (e.g., deadlift, bent-over row, etc.), and press (e.g., military press, etc.). Clients with more experience who are more advanced may further break down the movements into lower-body push, lower-body pull, upper-body push, upper-body pull, and press (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\nessentials of personal training, 2nd ed. (Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics).\\n\\nSEQUENCING EXAMPLE FOR HYPERTROPHY GOAL INTERMEDIATE: Muscular endurance (circuit training) → Hypertrophy (supersets) → Muscular strength (single set) → Hypertrophy (drop sets)\\n\\nADVANCED: Hypertrophy (drop sets) → Muscular strength (cluster sets) → Hypertrophy (compound sets) → Muscular strength (complex sets)\\n\\nMUSCULAR STRENGTH Maximum strength represents the maximal amount of force that can be generated by a muscle or group of muscles, regardless of the amount of time it takes (Tan, 1999). The muscular strength phase employs heavy loads (e.g., 1 – 6RM) and longer rest periods to increase the maximal level of force a muscle (or group of muscles) can generate, regardless of time.\\n\\nAn example strength workout might include 1 – 3 strength exercises, such as the back squat and bench press (3 – 6 sets of 3 – 6 reps with 3 min of rest) followed by assistance/complementary movements using hypertrophy variables, such as walking lunges, leg extensions, dumbbell flies, and triceps extensions (3 sets of 8 – 12 reps with 1 min of rest).\\n\\nOther program design techniques commonly used to increase maximum strength include cluster sets, the use of accommodating resistance, partial range of motion, and isometric work (Schoenfeld, 2011).', 'Compound set: performing 2 – 3 exercises for similar muscle groups\\n\\nCircuit training: performing one set of multiple exercises before repeating\\n\\nSupersets: performing alternating exercises for opposing muscle groups\\n\\nPyramid loading: increasing training load progressively and then decreasing\\n\\nDrop sets: performing a set to muscular failure with a given load and continuing immediately with additional sets at a lighter load\\n\\nHeavy negatives: performing eccentric-only work with a load greater than concentric 1RM\\n\\nForced reps: performing additional reps past volitional fatigue with the help of a spotter\\n\\nCluster sets: also known as rest-pause sets, utilize inter- repetition rest intervals of 10 – 30 s\\n\\nAccommodating resistance: incorporating bands and chains to free weight exercises to exert isokinetic resistance throughout the full range of motion\\n\\nPartial range of motion: performing an exercise in partial ranges of motion to increase strength at a particular joint angle\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN: PHASES OF TRAINING\\n\\nThe FFP and the corresponding training templates follow the linear periodization method. It should be noted, however, that there are numerous valid and effective periodization methods that can be implemented when working with clients.\\n\\nMUSCULAR ENDURANCE Muscular endurance is defined as the ability to maintain submaximal muscle actions (Willardson, 2008). Training for muscular endurance combines high repetition ranges with short rest periods, bringing about high levels of metabolic stress thereby requiring lighter loads to complete the prescribed number of repetitions. These lighter loads are not as effective in stimulating muscle hypertrophy as moderate loads with slightly longer rest periods (as recommended in the hypertrophy phase) (Schoenfeld, 2010).\\n\\nMuscular endurance training is most commonly performed with either standard exercise order (completing all sets of an exercise before moving on to another exercise) or through circuit training.\\n\\nResistance exercise performed through circuit training has been shown to improve VO2max, lactate threshold, body composition, and strength endurance in untrained populations (Waller, Miller, & Hannon, 2011). An essential component to successful implementation of circuit training is the rest period. While there are no specific rules for assigning the work-to-rest period, the FFP recommends that the personal trainer start novice clients with a 1:1 ratio then progress to a 2:1 ratio as the client’s fitness level improves.\\n\\n17', 'THEME\\n\\nFOCUS\\n\\nREPS\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nTOTAL VOLUME\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nRECOVERY\\n\\nWeek 1\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 2\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 3\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:1\\n\\n1:30\\n\\nWeek 4\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n20\\n\\nWeek 5\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n2:1\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 6\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nWeek 7\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n14\\n\\n4\\n\\n56\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nWeek 8\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n25\\n\\nWeek 9\\n\\nStrength gain\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n32\\n\\n2:2\\n\\nAs needed\\n\\nSTRENGTH TRAINING FOR THE OLDER CLIENT—A BLUEPRINT\\n\\nWeek 10\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nUnilateral\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n40\\n\\n1:1\\n\\n1:00\\n\\nFOR PROGRAM DESIGN\\n\\nWeek 11\\n\\nCardiovascular endurance\\n\\nBilateral\\n\\n12\\n\\n4\\n\\n48\\n\\n1:1\\n\\nReady go\\n\\nWeek 12\\n\\nMuscular endurance/deload\\n\\nFloor-based activities\\n\\n30', '11.

Not only is there a huge genetic component to the amount of muscle damage a client experiences, but also to how efficiently the client recovers (3).\\n\\n4. LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Day 1 – Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Bench Press | 4 | 6–8 | Focus on progressive overload for strength |\\n| Overhead Barbell Press | 4 | 6–8 | Targets shoulders, build overall pressing power |\\n| Incline Dumbbell Press | 3 | 8–12 | Achieves balanced upper chest development |\\n| Lateral Raises | 3 | 12–15 | Isolates lateral delts, enhances width |\\n| Triceps Dips | 3 | 8–12 | Use bodyweight or add weight for hypertrophy |\\n| Triceps Rope Pushdown | 3 | 12–15 | Focus on controlled form, targets triceps |\\n\\n### Day 2 – Pull (Back, Biceps)\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Deadlift | 4 | 5–6 | Key for building pulling strength and posterior chain |\\n| Bent-Over Barbell Row | 4 | 6–8 | Compound mover, develops back volume and power |\\n| Pull-Ups/Chin-Ups | 3 | 8–12 | Assist with bands if needed, core engagement |\\n| Seated Cable Row | 3 | 8–12 | Focus on scapular retraction |\\n| Barbell Bicep Curl | 3 | 8–12 | Use full range, control eccentric |\\n| Hammer Curls | 3 | 10–12 | Emphasizes brachialis for arm volume |\\n\\n### Day 3 – Legs & Core\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Back Squat | 4 | 6–8 | Focus on depth, progressive overload for size and strength |\\n| Romanian Deadlift | 4 | 8–10 | Targets hamstrings and glutes |\\n| Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 | 8–12 | Single-leg focus, hip stability |\\n| Standing Calf Raises | 4 | 12–15 | Full stretch and contraction |\\n| Hanging Leg Raises | 3 | 12–15 | Core strength, hip flexor engagement |\\n| Plank | 3 | 30–45s | Build core stability |\\n\\n**Notes:**  \\n- Prioritize compound movements first during each session to maximize strength gains and muscle recruitment.  \\n- Rest 1.5–3 minutes between sets on heavy lifts, 30–60 seconds on accessory work.  \\n- Aim for progressive overload weekly; increase weights or reps when feasible.  \\n- Stick to nutritional support for hypertrophy—aim for sufficient protein and caloric intake.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 585, 'prompt_tokens': 3436, 'total_tokens': 4021, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-9bb3518d-c642-4e95-8476-597924c6c740-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3436, 'output_tokens': 585, 'total_tokens': 4021, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

To make an exercise more challenging in the gym, one simply lifts heavier weights. At home, and with little or no equipment, the exercises themselves must become more challenging.\\n\\nThis guide is designed to help you build or maintain strength without equipment while away at home. Herein are weekly workouts for those that wish to train 2, 4, or 6 times each week. Each of these programs includes ways to make the exercises harder or easier depending on your fitness levels and goals.\\n\\nIn addition to this strength program, aerobic exercise is necessary for maintaining good health as well as helping stay fit and de-stress while we’re all at home. See the following pages and select the workout that is most appropriate for you. Above all, listen to your body and use your best judgement when approaching an exercise program on your own.\\n\\nBecause of copyright, all images and videos are linked to the original source online rather than embedded in this guide.

Some physical activity is\\n\\nbetter than none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous\\n\\nphysical activity gain some health benefits.\\n\\nFor substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30\\n\\nminutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and\\n\\n15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic\\n\\nphysical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic\\n\\nactivity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.\\n\\nAdditional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\\n\\nAdults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity\\n\\nand that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities', 'breathing and heart rate.\\n\\nA general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of moderate-intensity activity counts the same as 1 minute of\\n\\nvigorous-intensity activity. For example, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity is roughly the same as 15\\n\\nminutes of vigorous-intensity activity.\\n\\nMuscle-Strengthening Activities At least 2 days a week, older adults should do muscle-\\n\\nstrengthening activities that involve all the major muscle\\n\\ngroups. These are the muscles of the legs, hips, chest, back,\\n\\nabdomen, shoulders, and arms. The improvements in, or\\n\\nmaintenance of, muscular strength are specific to the\\n\\nmuscles used during the activity, so a variety of activities is\\n\\nnecessary to achieve balanced muscle strength.\\n\\nMuscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work\\n\\nthan they are accustomed to during activities of daily life.\\n\\nExamples of muscle-strengthening activities include lifting\\n\\nweights, working with resistance bands, doing calisthenics\\n\\nthat use body weight for resistance (such as push-ups, pull-\\n\\nups, and planks), climbing stairs, shoveling snow, and carrying', 'a 15-min walk during your lunch break, and taking your children out for a walk or run around the neighborhood after dinner. Look for opportunities to incorporate physical activity and exercise into your lifestyle as much as possible. Many employees who spend much of their day working on computers find it helpful to follow either a 25-5 or 50-10 strategy. The 25-5 or 50-10 strategy states that for every 25 (or 50) min of work, take a break of 5 (or 10) min to move around, stretch, relax, and refocus the mind. While this sounds counterintuitive to productivity, research suggests there are no adverse effects when breaks are relatively short (9). Additionally, active breaks with a change in posture may be effective in reducing pain and discomfort that is commonly associated with prolonged sitting (20). A higher quality and quantity of work may even be accomplished due to the increased focus and efficiency and decreased likelihood of distraction during the larger blocks of time.\\n\\nIt is recommended to form an activity plan at the beginning of each week or month. A key component is being able to execute the plan, so it depends on your individual capability to stay consistent. Set aside the days that you intend to exercise along with the days that you intend to rest and recover. Note that the health benefits of exercise will only be maximized if you balance the volume and intensity of your exercise with adequate amounts of rest and recovery (7). Also, set aside the time of day that you plan to exercise—morning, afternoon, evening, or night. This level of intentionality makes it more likely that you will follow through with action. There will certainly be days that you will not want to exercise, but making it part of your routine will help keep you consistent. Regular activity can increase energy during the day, improve sleep quality at night, help with stress management, improve emotional well-being, and enhance cognition (13).\\n\\nWORKOUT PARTNERS Although it may sound silly at first, one of the best ways for parents to get more physical activity throughout the day is to have children become workout partners. If workout equipment is available at home, kids can exercise alongside the parent. The children can do squats, overhead presses, and core exercises, or could climb around on a bench or power rack, hit a punching bag, swing from hanging rings, or make obstacle courses using dumbbells, barbells, and jump ropes while parents perform their workout. While the opportunities available to each family will be based on prioritizing the safety of everyone involved and the equipment present, such creative physical activity with children lets parents get their exercise while spending time with their kids and positively influencing their future fitness habits.\\n\\nInformally, you can play games with your children that involve actions such as running, climbing, throwing, or kicking. Such activities can range from organized sports to games that are\\n\\n6\\n\\nPTQ 11.2 | NSCA.COM Copyright National Strength and Conditioning Association 2024\\n\\nPTQ 11.2\\n\\nMAINTAINING HEALTH AND FITNESS IN PARENTHOOD—', 'regular physical activity and activities of daily life.

Exercises traditionally utilized in the power phase include traditional barbell Olympic- style lifts (the snatch and the clean and jerk) and plyometrics. However, the Olympic-style lifts require a high degree of technical experience along with a high degree of mobility and stability; it is not always realistic to expect the everyday client to be able to perform Olympic-style lifts. However, power training can still be performed safely and effectively using explosive exercises and various implements, such as medicine balls, dumbbells, kettlebells, and bodyweight (plyometrics).\\n\\nTraining for power is typically performed with standard exercise order described earlier. Two other methods that require more research, but appear to improve the development of power, are complex sets and cluster sets.\\n\\nComplex sets can be used to improve both strength and power by performing biomechanically similar exercises in pairs (two similar exercises) or triads (three similar exercises). Complex sets typically begin with a strength exercise followed by a power exercise. In theory, training using cluster sets is thought to stimulate motor unit excitability, increase phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, and decrease presynaptic inhibition. This response is thought to augment power output and is collectively termed postactivation potentiation (PAP). Training with complex sets seems to be more beneficial in clients with higher levels of strength and is not typically recommended for novice clients. Prior to implementing complex sets into training, a client should have a solid strength base and be proficient in plyometric training (Carter & Greenwood, 2014).', 'CONTENTS\\n\\n2x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Beginner). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n2x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Intermediate). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n2x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Advanced). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n4x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Beginner). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n4x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Intermediate). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n4x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Advanced). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n6x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Beginner). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n6x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Intermediate). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n6x/Week No-Equipment Strength Workout (Advanced). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10', 'No Equipment Home Workouts: strength workouts\\n\\nThe key to strength training is performing challenging exercises for repetitions and multiple sets.

Not only is there a huge genetic component to the amount of muscle damage a client experiences, but also to how efficiently the client recovers (3).\\n\\n4. LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.', 'EXERCISE\\n\\nMUSCLES WORKED\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nREPS/TIME\\n\\nREST\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\nA1 B1\\n\\nJoint Mobility Warm-Up\\n\\nWhole Body\\n\\n1\\n\\n5-10 min\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nUse video or your own dynamic warm up.\\n\\nA1\\n\\nJump Squats\\n\\nQuads, Glutes, Hamstrings\\n\\n4\\n\\n8 reps\\n\\n30 sec\\n\\nLand softly.

A study conducted by Santos et al. found that the addition of barbell hip thrusts to resistance training is effective in significantly increasing gluteus maximus muscle hypertrophy (10).

LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.', 'SUMMARY POINTS\\n\\nManipulation of the acute resistance training variables is critical to program design. The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25). Individualized training programs must to maximize performance enhancement.', 'It appears that training adaptations of single factors (i.e., high force, high power) occur only after a base level of strength and power training has been achieved. This notion is supported by the fact that if the athlete already has an adequate level of strength, then the increases in maximal power performance in response to traditional strength training will be poor. More specific training interventions will be required to further improve maximal power output (45). Thus, improvement of maximal power output in trained athletes may require more complex training strategies than previously thought (102).\\n\\nThis contention is supported by research (101) comparing changes in 1RM squat, vertical jump, and flying 20 m sprint velocity during eight weeks of either weight training or plyometric training. Subjects were classified as weak or strong based on their pretraining 1RM squat. The results demonstrated significant negative relationships between improvements induced by weight training in sprinting, jumping, and pretraining 1RM performance. The authors hypothesized that this was due to the principle of diminishing returns, whereby initial improvements in muscular function are easily attained, but further improvements are progressively harder to achieve. Unexpectedly, the performance gains from the plyometric training were unrelated to initial strength levels.\\n\\nFIGURE 5.3 Changes to the force–velocity and force–power relationships for the jump squat (i.e., a CMJ with a bar held across the shoulders) in response to 10 weeks of heavy resistance training (a and b) and ballistic power training (c and d).

A personal trainer can set up the split with a quadriceps day, a hamstring day, and a glute day. Using the upper/ lower split training, the personal trainer could set up the split like this example: Day 1 – squat variation, hinge variation, single-leg hip thrust variation, and abduction variation; Day 2 – hip thrust variation, lunge variation, hinge variation, and abduction variation; Day 3 – deadlift variation, squat variation, hip thrust variation, and abduction variation.\\n\\n7. REST TIME The author recommends approximately 2 – 3 min of rest between sets in general, 3 – 6 min of rest between sets when going for personal records on compound lifts, and 60 – 90 s for isolation exercises (6). Appropriate rest helps ensure adequate effort, volume, and load without wasting too much time.\\n\\nREFERENCES 1. Calatayud, J, Casaña, J, Martín, F, Jakobsen, MD, Andersen, LL, and Colado, JC.

REST AND RECOVERY Finally, make sure to give the client’s body enough time to rest and recover between training sessions. This can help reduce injury due to overtraining, reduce muscle soreness, and allow muscles to repair and grow. The client will only benefit from the training that they can effectively recover from. Insufficient recovery could be due to poor nutrition, poor sleep, training too much, or combining training with opposing goals (e.g., too much cardio when the goal is strength). Not only is recovery a part of programming, nutrition, sleep, and stress management are also important to optimize progress. CONCLUSION In the pursuit of powerful and functional glutes, program design is paramount to optimal strength and hypertrophy. As a personal trainer delves into the intricacies of sculpting powerful glutes, it is important to remember that it is not a one-size-fits-all journey. Designing a program depends on many factors, such as individual differences and training goals. Experimentation is needed to modify the program to suit the individual client.\\n\\n2.

While there is no best scientifically-proven way to periodize a program, there are many methods that a personal trainer can employ to successfully build stronger glutes in their clients. This article provides eight considerations when designing a program to optimally build the glutes.\\n\\nLATERAL/ROTARY GLUTE EXERCISES Lateral/rotary glute exercises movements (e.g., lateral band walks, cable chop and lift variations, machine and band seated hip abduction) train the glute medius in the frontal and transverse plane while involving shorter muscle lengths. In other words, these exercises tend not to involve much of a stretch on the glutes because they work through a small range of motion and do not stress in the lengthened position. These movements are great for producing a burn, which provides metabolic stress. Thus, these exercises are less likely to cause overall fatigue and soreness.\\n\\n1. EXERCISE SELECTION Compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, lunges, hip thrusts, and glute bridges can be used as staples in a glute training program because these exercises target multiple muscle groups, including the glutes, while allowing for heavier loads to be lifted, which can result in greater muscle growth. A study conducted by Santos et al. found that the addition of barbell hip thrusts to resistance training is effective in significantly increasing gluteus maximus muscle hypertrophy (10). This study compared the effects of performing 45-degree leg presses and stiff-leg deadlifts versus performing 45-degree leg presses, stiff-leg deadlifts, and barbell hip thrusts on gluteus maximus muscle size on 33 untrained young women (10). Over the 10-week training period, there was a notable difference in muscle size growth with the addition of the barbell hip thrust (10). Different exercises load the glutes in different directions, which relates to body positioning and the ways in which the resistance is affecting it. Therefore, the author recommends to include the following types of glute exercises:\\n\\nThe frontal plane will target the glute medius more while the transverse plane will also incorporate some glute maximus muscle fibers (3). In addition to incorporating exercises from all three categories, the author also recommends employing exercise variety and choosing exercises that suit the individual client’s anatomy the best. Using the mind-muscle connection model, personal trainers should have their client think about the muscle that is being worked and experiment with different stances, ranges of motion, postures, and pelvic positions to determine which gives them the most glute activation (3).\\n\\nPRACTICAL PROGRAM DESIGN FOR GLUTE DEVELOPMENT The following four movement patterns are recommended to focus on during training session to maximize glute development (3):\\n\\n1. Thrust/Bridge: These are hip thrust, glute bridge, and frog pump patterns. These movements target the lower and upper glutes.\\n\\nHORIZONTAL HIP EXTENSION EXERCISES These movements will train the upper and lower subdivisions of the glute maximus in the shortened position, which is at the top when locked out (e.g., hip thrusts, frog pumps, back extensions, kickbacks, glute bridges). These exercises should not result in as much fatigue or soreness because they train the glutes at short muscle lengths (2).\\n\\n2. Squat/Lunge: These are squat and split squat patterns along with step-ups and pistol squats. These movements target the lower glutes and quadriceps.\\n\\n3. Hinge/Pull: These are deadlift, back extension, and reverse hyperextension patterns. These movements target the lower glutes and hamstrings.', 'of vertical glute exercises, and 12 sets of lateral/rotary glute exercises.\\n\\nTrain glutes 2 – 6 times per week depending on program variables (e.g., volume, effort, exercise selection, etc.).\\n\\nHow much volume a client can handle heavily depends on genetics, exercise effort, gender, sleep, and stress management. Not only is there a huge genetic component to the amount of muscle damage a client experiences, but also to how efficiently the client recovers (3).\\n\\n4. LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.', 'the squat\\n\\nAllowing the weight to shift to the toes\\n\\nFigure 4-49. Clean Style Grip\\n\\nWithout question, the squat is the single most effective leg exercise. This strength training exercise involves a large portion of the muscular system. Remember that every athlete’s squat will vary based on differences in body types, length of the legs, and flexibility of the ankles. Technique will vary based on differences in stance widths, the use of heel blocks, and positioning of the bar (high or low) on the back. Coaches should instruct athletes to stabilize the torso by engaging the core. Never flex the spine (i.e., round forward) during a squat. Overall, the key to performing the squat is to do it correctly and carefully. Squats are not “bad for your knees.” The fact is that if you have healthy knees, they are quite capable of handling even the heaviest weight that your body can tolerate (2,4,5).\\n\\nFigure 4-50.

Distribute bodyweight from the balls of the feet to the heels\\n\\nWhen done correctly, front squats build the muscles, ligaments, and tendons surrounding the knee. This exercise is great for athletes who have problems keeping erect during back squats. If an erect position is not maintained during this lift, the bar will roll forward.\\n\\n4.

Not only is there a huge genetic component to the amount of muscle damage a client experiences, but also to how efficiently the client recovers (3).\\n\\n4. LOAD AND INTENSITY Perform a blend of repetition ranges: high repetitions, medium repetitions, and low repetitions. Practically, this recommendation involves performing a third of the volume with high repetitions, a third with moderate repetitions, and a third with low repetitions, which yields the best overall muscle development. Research shows that muscle growth can occur in all repetition ranges as long as there is high exertion levels (12). Reaching actual failure is not necessary and can be counterproductive (12). It is not uncommon to see clients perform all of their sets where they are approaching failure week by week and can barely perform another repetition. This may lead to fatigue and stagnation in strength gains (8). Therefore, it is important to consider leaving a few repetitions in reserve and aim for progression week by week. By programming glute training in the way previously described, the client will be more likely to train the glutes from every angle and joint action, thereby maximizing transfer to sport performance and functional activities; fully develop the upper and lower subdivisions of the gluteus maximus; and be able to tolerate higher workloads without accumulating excessive fatigue.', 'Sample Strength and Conditioning 12-Week Program\\n\\n19\\n\\nBase Phase\\n\\nBasics of Strength and Conditioning - Twelve Week Program\\n\\nMonday - Explosive\\n\\nWeek 1 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 2 - 70%\\n\\nWeek 3 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 4 - 75%\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nUnload\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nLifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Rack Shrug OR Rack Jump OR Rack Clean\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB High Pull\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB Standing Shoulder Press OR DB Shoulder Raises\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nPulling Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nBicep Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nAb Planks\\n\\n2x 15-30 seconds\\n\\n3x 15-30 seconds\\n\\n3x 30-45 seconds\\n\\n3x 30-45 seconds\\n\\nTuesday - Strength\\n\\nWeek 1 - 60%\\n\\nWeek 2 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 3 - 60%\\n\\nWeek 4 - 70%\\n\\nLifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Front Squat OR Modified Squat\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nBB Romanian Deadlift (RDL)\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nSingle Leg Choice\\n\\n2x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\n3x10ea\\n\\nBB Incline Bench Press\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nTriceps Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nAB Choice\\n\\n2x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\n3x10\\n\\nThursday - Explosive\\n\\nWeek 1 - 60%\\n\\nWeek 2 - 65%\\n\\nWeek 3 - 60%\\n\\nWeek 4 - 70%'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Week 1 – Lower Body Focus\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Bodyweight Squats | 3 | 8-12 | Use a chair for support if needed, focus on controlled movement to build strength |\\n| Split Squat | 3 | 6-8/leg | Hold onto a support for balance, target quads and glutes |\\n| Glute Bridge | 3 | 10-12 | Lift hips fully, squeeze glutes at the top |\\n| Penguin Crunch | 3 | 15/side | Engage core, stabilize pelvis |\\n| Reverse Crunches | 3 | 12-15 | Focus on abs activation, control descent |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 155, 'prompt_tokens': 2506, 'total_tokens': 2661, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f8ebfd7f-b0bd-4654-9fcc-55f021703456-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2506, 'output_tokens': 155, 'total_tokens': 2661, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

Malek (eds.), 2012, NSCA’s\\n\\nExisting strength training guidelines suggest that primary exercises (complex multi-joint movements) be performed first, followed by assistance exercises (smaller muscles/muscle groups and single-joint movements). Standard exercise order seems to be the most effective for optimal strength gains because it allows greater recovery between sets compared to muscular endurance or hypertrophy training. Max strength training is typically performed by movement groups (as opposed to training individual body parts), such as push (e.g., squat, lunge, bench press, etc.), pull (e.g., deadlift, bent-over row, etc.), and press (e.g., military press, etc.). Clients with more experience who are more advanced may further break down the movements into lower-body push, lower-body pull, upper-body push, upper-body pull, and press (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\nessentials of personal training, 2nd ed.

The muscular strength phase employs heavy loads (e.g., 1 – 6RM) and longer rest periods to increase the maximal level of force a muscle (or group of muscles) can generate, regardless of time.\\n\\nAn example strength workout might include 1 – 3 strength exercises, such as the back squat and bench press (3 – 6 sets of 3 – 6 reps with 3 min of rest) followed by assistance/complementary movements using hypertrophy variables, such as walking lunges, leg extensions, dumbbell flies, and triceps extensions (3 sets of 8 – 12 reps with 1 min of rest).\\n\\nOther program design techniques commonly used to increase maximum strength include cluster sets, the use of accommodating resistance, partial range of motion, and isometric work (Schoenfeld, 2011).', 'There are many ways to make an effective glute building program when it comes to periodizing the program design variables. Using evidence-based information, personal trainers may want to start with training the muscle group at least two times per week and start with roughly about 10 sets (depending on how the individual recovers). The rule of thirds ensures that the strength and physique training program is productive, balanced, and efficient while providing structure for the program design principles and exercise selection by considering vector, load, and effort along with taking into consideration the levels of mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage for for the upper and lower glute max subdivisions.\\n\\n7.

Within their scope of practice (i.e., what is versus what is not legally defensible in a given profession), personal trainers can share general nutrition information from sources that are public domain, such as textbooks, research articles, and trustworthy websites. However, regulations for scope of practice vary from state to state. Personal trainers should review their individual state regulations, which are provided by the Center for Nutrition Advocacy (http://nutritionadvocacy.org/laws-state).\\n\\nIt is well within a personal trainer’s scope of practice to address misinformation and to give general advice related to nutrition for physical performance, disease prevention, weight loss, and weight gain (Spano, 2012). Personal trainers can also provide clients with research-based recommendations, such as estimated daily protein, fat, carbohydrate, and caloric intake. These recommendations are based on equations and are very general in nature; it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain an accurate estimate of a client’s energy expenditure.\\n\\nTake-home message: Personal trainers can educate a client based on generally accepted, research-based principles but should never prescribe specific diets or supplements.\\n\\n21\\n\\nPRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEIGHT LOSS Training for weight loss (i.e., increased lean body mass/decreased fat mass) is one of the most common reasons a client hires a personal trainer. Sometimes, when a personal trainer hears “weight loss” they mistakenly assume the client needs to perform high-repetition circuits or cardiovascular training, as the common misconception is that heavy weights lead to hypertrophy and “bulking.” However, a decrease in fat mass can be attained through any number of nutritional and training variations, but one constant remains: the client needs to create a caloric deficit (ideally through a combination of nutrition, cardiovascular exercise, and resistance training exercise) (Spano, 2012).\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe ability to gain muscle and lose body fat simultaneously depends on a client’s training status, training program, and nutrition. However, it is more difficult for trained individuals who have a low percentage of body fat to achieve this.\\n\\n2. Weight loss of 1 – 2 lb (about 1% of total bodyweight) per\\n\\nweek is a common guideline (Spano, 2012). This represents a daily caloric deficit of 500 – 1,000 calories per day achieved through a combination of diet and exercise.\\n\\n3. Clients should consume protein frequently throughout the day to meet their overall daily requirements (Antonio & La Bounty, 2011).\\n\\n4.

Subsequent sets of a given exercise must begin before complete recovery has been reached, which causes increased metabolic stress (Buresh, Berg, & French, 2009). It is important to adjust the load and/or rest periods to assure that exercise technique is not compromised.\\n\\nHYPERTROPHY Muscle hypertrophy refers to an increase in cross-sectional area (CSA) brought about from a net increase or growth of the contractile proteins actin and myosin (myofibrillar hypertrophy), as well as glycogen and intracellular fluids (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy). To accomplish this increase in CSA, the hypertrophy phase combines moderate loads, repetitions, and rest intervals to elicit muscular tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage, all of which act as stimuli for adaptations. This combination of moderate loads, higher relative volume, and rest intervals can also cause an increase in circulating testosterone and growth hormones, which lead to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein degradation (Schoenfeld, 2010).\\n\\nHypertrophy training is often performed in body part “splits” or upper/lower body alternating routines, whereby exercises that focus on the upper body are performed on one day and exercises for the lower body the next day.

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['When constructing a training plan, several blocks of accumulation, transmutation, and realization can be linked together in order to direct training toward specific physiological and performance outcomes. If sequenced appropriately, the athlete’s level of preparedness and performance will increase across the sequentially linked blocks of training and in response to the realization block (figures 11.14-11.16). Figure 11.14 presents an example of a conjugated sequencing model in which a systematic overlapping of accumulation, transmutation, and realization blocks is used to direct preparedness for speed-strength performance.\\n\\nFIGURE 11.14 Sequencing of accumulation, transmutation, and restitution blocks of training for speed strength development. Adapted from Siff (69), Siff and Verkoshansky (70), and Stone, Stone, and Sands (80).\\n\\nIn this example, two accumulation blocks (A1 and A2) contain high-volume, low- intensity strength training. During this time, performance is expected to decrease in response to accumulative fatigue (80). During the transmutation blocks (T1 and T2), the training focus shifts toward high-intensity speed work coupled with technical training. The reduction in training load and the shift in training emphasis results in a dissipation of accumulated fatigue and stimulates a corresponding elevation in preparedness. After the second transmutation phase (T2), a realization (R1) block is planned. In this block, training load will be further reduced and performance will supercompensate in response to a further reduction in accumulated fatigue (69, 80, 88).\\n\\nFigure 11.14 represents a basic conjugated sequencing model, but more complex training structures can be created (figures 11.15 and 11.16). For example, in figure 11.15, the sequencing of training factors is more complex. In this example, the targeted performance outcome is, again, speed and strength. It presents a more complex illustration for a sequential ordering of the accumulation, transmutation, and realization blocks of training. The accumulation block is contained in the first half of the training structure. This block depicts an early emphasis that centers on strength-endurance and anaerobic conditioning, followed by a shift toward maximal strength and an increasing emphasis on technical (i.e., skill) training and speed training. In the second half of the this plan, the early portion represents the transmutation block, which shifts the emphasis toward the development of strength and power while continuing to focus on technical and speed training. Anaerobic conditioning is maintained. The final portion of the presented structure depicts the realization block, where technical and speed training are the primary focus and minimal emphasis is placed on anaerobic conditioning. Here, strength/power capabilities peak.\\n\\nFIGURE 11.15 Sample sequencing of training that targets speed-strength development. Adapted from Siff (69) and Siff and Verkoshansky (70).\\n\\nFIGURE 11.16 Sample sequencing model for a sport that requires medium-duration endurance. Adapted from Issurin (43, 44), Plisk (62), and Bompa and Haff (6).\\n\\nAnother example of a conjugated sequencing model is presented in figure 11.16.

Subsequent sets of a given exercise must begin before complete recovery has been reached, which causes increased metabolic stress (Buresh, Berg, & French, 2009). It is important to adjust the load and/or rest periods to assure that exercise technique is not compromised.\\n\\nHYPERTROPHY Muscle hypertrophy refers to an increase in cross-sectional area (CSA) brought about from a net increase or growth of the contractile proteins actin and myosin (myofibrillar hypertrophy), as well as glycogen and intracellular fluids (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy). To accomplish this increase in CSA, the hypertrophy phase combines moderate loads, repetitions, and rest intervals to elicit muscular tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage, all of which act as stimuli for adaptations. This combination of moderate loads, higher relative volume, and rest intervals can also cause an increase in circulating testosterone and growth hormones, which lead to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein degradation (Schoenfeld, 2010).\\n\\nHypertrophy training is often performed in body part “splits” or upper/lower body alternating routines, whereby exercises that focus on the upper body are performed on one day and exercises for the lower body the next day. Typical splits include chest, shoulders, and triceps; back and biceps; and legs. Other programming techniques used for hypertrophy may include forced reps, drop sets, supersets, compound sets, and heavy negatives.\\n\\n18\\n\\nRegardless of the method employed, the goal of hypertrophy workouts is to induce metabolic stress, muscle tension, and appropriate levels of muscle damage.', 'STRENGTH TRAINING VARIABLES\\n\\nBEGINNER\\n\\nINTERMEDIATE ADVANCED\\n\\nDuration\\n\\n2 – 4 weeks\\n\\n2 – 4 weeks\\n\\n2 – 4 weeks\\n\\nSets per exercise\\n\\n1 – 3\\n\\n≥ 3\\n\\n≥ 3\\n\\nTraining with heavier loads and longer rest periods can result in positive neural and physiological adaptations. The neural improvements have been shown to occur earlier in the training phase, typically the first two months for novice clients. The physiological adaptations (primarily increased CSA) occur later in the training. Training for maximum strength improves the ability to recruit fast-twitch muscle fibers, which typically are not recruited when training with lighter loads, especially among novice clients (Weir & Brown, 2012).\\n\\nReps per set\\n\\nRest between sets\\n\\nLoad/intensity (% of 1RM)\\n\\nVolume/intensity relationship\\n\\n≤ 6\\n\\n2 – 5 min\\n\\n≥ 70%\\n\\nLow/high\\n\\n≤ 6\\n\\n2 – 5 min\\n\\n≥ 80%\\n\\nLow/high\\n\\n≤ 6\\n\\n2 – 5 min\\n\\n≥ 85%\\n\\nLow/high\\n\\nAdapted, with permission, J.W.

Load manipulation within a set is typically performed in an undulating (using a pyramid loading scheme) fashion. Theoretically, the undulating cluster training elicits a potentiation effect allowing for greater overall power outputs and barbell velocities. Undulating cluster training should be reserved for highly experienced clients (Haff, et al., 2008).\\n\\nMUSCULAR POWER While more often thought of for use with athletes, fitness clients can also benefit from power training. In fact, power training has been shown to increase older adults’ ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) more than standard strength training (Haff G. H., 2012).', 'HYPERTROPHY VARIABLES\\n\\nBEGINNER\\n\\nINTERMEDIATE ADVANCED\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, sequencing of training has a complementary effect. This means that initially increasing the CSA of muscle fibers may promote greater increases in strength with subsequent training.

Malek (eds.), 2012, NSCA’s\\n\\nExisting strength training guidelines suggest that primary exercises (complex multi-joint movements) be performed first, followed by assistance exercises (smaller muscles/muscle groups and single-joint movements). Standard exercise order seems to be the most effective for optimal strength gains because it allows greater recovery between sets compared to muscular endurance or hypertrophy training. Max strength training is typically performed by movement groups (as opposed to training individual body parts), such as push (e.g., squat, lunge, bench press, etc.), pull (e.g., deadlift, bent-over row, etc.), and press (e.g., military press, etc.). Clients with more experience who are more advanced may further break down the movements into lower-body push, lower-body pull, upper-body push, upper-body pull, and press (Haff G. H., 2012).\\n\\nessentials of personal training, 2nd ed.

The muscular strength phase employs heavy loads (e.g., 1 – 6RM) and longer rest periods to increase the maximal level of force a muscle (or group of muscles) can generate, regardless of time.\\n\\nAn example strength workout might include 1 – 3 strength exercises, such as the back squat and bench press (3 – 6 sets of 3 – 6 reps with 3 min of rest) followed by assistance/complementary movements using hypertrophy variables, such as walking lunges, leg extensions, dumbbell flies, and triceps extensions (3 sets of 8 – 12 reps with 1 min of rest).\\n\\nOther program design techniques commonly used to increase maximum strength include cluster sets, the use of accommodating resistance, partial range of motion, and isometric work (Schoenfeld, 2011).', 'Technique Fundamentals\\n\\n28\\n\\nShoulder Press\\n\\nHandgrips\\n\\n28\\n\\n3c.

The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25). Individualized training programs must to maximize performance enhancement.', '11. Haff, G., Hobbs, R. T., Haff, E. E., Sands, W. A., Pierce, K. C., & Stone, M. H. (2008, February).

Many variations or progressions of single- and multiple-joint exercises can be performed. One facet is the use of either free weights or machines. Both have been recommended for inclusion in resistance training programs. Free weights consist of barbells, dumbbells, and associated equipment (i.e., plates, collars, benches). Machines encompass a variety of specifically designed pieces of equipment that provide resistance within some prescribed range of motion and movement pattern.\\n\\nBoth free weights and machines are very effective for increasing muscle strength and performance, and both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the needs of the athlete. Machines provide greater stability and control the path of movement. Free weights require the lifter to control all aspects of the exercise. Stabilizer muscles are stressed to a higher degree when free-weight exercises are performed. This has led to the suggestion that machine exercises are safer and easier to learn initially, while free weights stress total muscular development to a larger degree. Due to specificity of training, free-weight training leads to greater improvements in free-weight tests and machine training results in greater performance on machine tests (6). When a neutral testing device is used, strength improvement from free weights and machines appear to produce similar results (38). Free weight training appears more applicable to improving athletic performance.\\n\\nHowever, some machines enable the performance of exercises that would be very difficult to perform with free weights (e.g., leg curls, lat pulldowns, tricep pushdowns). These machines may be considered essential. They can provide a benefit to the individual athlete (12). However, the decision to include free-weight or machine exercises may depend on other factors, such as equipment availability and cost.\\n\\nIn addition to free weights and machines, performance of exercises in unstable\\n\\nenvironments (e.g., with stability balls, wobble boards, and BOSU balls) has become a popular modality of training. These exercises can increase the activity of trunk muscles and other stabilizer muscles (compared to stable environments). However, since lighter weights must be lifted, the stimulus for maximal strength enhancement and force production is limited. In addition, recent research has indicated that structural movements, such as the squat and power clean exercise, are more effective than exercise on unstable surfaces in activating core muscle groups such as the trunk (23). There still may be some usefulness of exercises performed on unstable surfaces (i.e., rehabilitation). Chapter 10 discusses this in further detail. Strongman competition exercises have also become a popular method of training for many diverse populations. Exercises such as stone or barrel lifting, farmer’s walk, log press, tire lifting, and truck towing (to name a few) stress all major muscle groups and produce a high level of neuromuscular and metabolic challenge, creating a beneficial stimulus for total body strength and conditioning. Lastly, exercises can be performed with alternative equipment, such as sandbags, kegs, kettle bells, bands and chains (which provide variable resistance to full exercise range of motion), and thick bars. A multitude of exercises can be performed in a variety of conditions that provide many options for the strength and conditioning professional and athlete.', 'EXERCISE\\n\\nMUSCLES WORKED\\n\\nSETS\\n\\nREPS/TIME\\n\\nREST\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\n1\\n\\nJoint Mobility Warm-Up\\n\\nWhole Body\\n\\n1\\n\\n5-10 min\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nUse video or your own dynamic warm up.\\n\\n2\\n\\nJump Squats\\n\\nQuads, Glutes, Hamstrings\\n\\n4\\n\\n8 reps\\n\\n30 sec\\n\\nLand softly.

Usually both are needed, but the specifics of the sport should be kept in mind. The following guidelines will help athletes, sport and conditioning professionals, and therapists structure and implement a program for functional joint stabilization.\\n\\nEarly in the rehabilitation process, exercises should be performed in the mid- range of shoulder movement, slowly continuing toward the ends of the range of motion of problematic or unstable joints. The same principle should be followed to influence and improve feeling in a certain position. Mid-range muscle receptors are of primary importance. To achieve good scapulothoracic stabilization, exercises facilitating synergistic parascapular contractions should be used, such as punches, push-ups, and press-ups against higher resistance.\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, the shoulder joint is a complex structure. Its soundness is enabled by different subcomponents of the stability apparatus. These components can be mobilized by different perturbation types (direction of the perturbing force, amount of applied force, and repeatability). These disturbances should be close to those encountered in the athlete’s sport. For example, throwing athletes can use oscillatory disturbances in the late cocking phase to stimulate the change from the eccentric to the concentric part of the throw, additionally stressing active stabilizers. In impingement syndromes, exercises should be performed with minimal adduction of the humerus. If possible, active adduction should be performed. This\\n\\ncan be achieved by holding a towel between the upper arm and the torso. In compromised shoulder stability, exercises in the scapular plane should be used, since active stabilizers are most effective in ensuring joint stiffness. In rhythmic stabilization exercises, it is very important to additionally stress the preparatory and reactive muscle activity in order to improve functional joint stabilization.\\n\\nSlow progression in plyometric exercises is valuable, since they can help the neuromuscular system better cope with stress during throwing or hitting. As such, they train eccentric muscle activity, enabling better eccentric control. They also increase sense of joint position in the late cocking phase, which is usually performed in the extremes of lateral rotation, and increase muscle stiffness, enabling better use of elastic energy and counteraction to extensive perturbations. During latter stages of rehabilitation and in injury prevention programs, exercises should mimic sport-specific movements, including their position (overhead extreme lateral rotation, elevated stress in contact position in spiking or hitting a ball with a racquet) and function. Elevated stress, such as plyometrics or additional loading, should be applied only when the athlete has achieved a full, pain-free range of motion, strength, and dynamic stability.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Shoulder Focus – Hypertrophy & Strength\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Overhead Press | 4 | 8–10 | Use a shoulder-width grip, focus on controlled movement for muscle activation |\\n| Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 10–12 | Eliminate momentum, keep core engaged |\\n| Cable Lateral Raises | 3 | 12–15 | Targets lateral delts, maintain steady tension |\\n| Dumbbell Front Raises | 3 | 10–12 | Keep arms slightly bent, lift to shoulder height |\\n| Rear Delt Machine Flyes | 3 | 12–15 | Focus on scapular retraction, targets posterior delts |\\n| Dumbbell Shrugs | 3 | 15–20 | Squeeze traps at the top, improve overall shoulder stability |\\n| Face Pulls | 3 | 12–15 | Use rope attachment, focus on external rotation and rear delts |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 214, 'prompt_tokens': 2889, 'total_tokens': 3103, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-7ac683bd-c91e-4473-9396-011ad9b915bc-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2889, 'output_tokens': 214, 'total_tokens': 3103, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

Triceps Choice', 'It appears that training adaptations of single factors (i.e., high force, high power) occur only after a base level of strength and power training has been achieved. This notion is supported by the fact that if the athlete already has an adequate level of strength, then the increases in maximal power performance in response to traditional strength training will be poor. More specific training interventions will be required to further improve maximal power output (45). Thus, improvement of maximal power output in trained athletes may require more complex training strategies than previously thought (102).\\n\\nThis contention is supported by research (101) comparing changes in 1RM squat, vertical jump, and flying 20 m sprint velocity during eight weeks of either weight training or plyometric training. Subjects were classified as weak or strong based on their pretraining 1RM squat. The results demonstrated significant negative relationships between improvements induced by weight training in sprinting, jumping, and pretraining 1RM performance. The authors hypothesized that this was due to the principle of diminishing returns, whereby initial improvements in muscular function are easily attained, but further improvements are progressively harder to achieve. Unexpectedly, the performance gains from the plyometric training were unrelated to initial strength levels.\\n\\nFIGURE 5.3 Changes to the force–velocity and force–power relationships for the jump squat (i.e., a CMJ with a bar held across the shoulders) in response to 10 weeks of heavy resistance training (a and b) and ballistic power training (c and d).

The human body usually adapts to its current workload within one or two weeks. Thus, programs must be continually altered to keep the training stimuli potent and to avoid training plateaus. Any resistance training program can be effective as long as progressive overload, specificity, and variation are incorporated.\\n\\nWays to make workouts more demanding (in accordance with specific goals) include (1) increasing the weights or loads lifted, (2) adding repetitions to the current workload, (3) increasing lifting velocity with sub- to near-maximal loads to enhance the neuromuscular response, (4) lengthening rest intervals to enable greater loading or reducing them to target muscular endurance, (5) increasing training volume within reasonable limits (i.e., 2.5% to 5%), and (6) introducing other advanced training techniques for supramaximal loading (12, 25).\\n\\nWithout progressive overload (a gradual increase in stress placed on the body), no adaptation will take place. Thus, lifters must strive to progressively train harder over time in order to continue progressing.\\n\\nSpecificity refers to designing programs specifically to targeted goals. Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus. This includes specificity of muscle actions trained, range of motion, energy system utilization, velocity, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns (25). Individualized training programs must to maximize performance enhancement.', 'Sample Strength and Conditioning 12-Week Program\\n\\n19\\n\\nBase Phase\\n\\nBasics of Strength and Conditioning - Twelve

      "Returned: {'contexts': ['Increasing Intensity\\n\\nThree basic methods exist for increasing loading during progressive resistance training: (1) increasing relative percents of 1RM, (2) training within a repetition maximum (RM) zone, and (3) increasing absolute amounts. Increasing relative percents is common in periodized programs, especially for Olympic lifts and variations, squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. Athletes may train with 70% of their predetermined 1RM for one set and at 80% during the next set. Percents can be used to vary intensity from set to set or to quantify a training cycle (e.g., hypertrophy cycle may be characteristic of intensities of 67% to 75% of 1RM, versus a strength cycle, which may be characteristic of intensities greater than 85% of 1RM). Over a long training cycle, a relative percent can exceed 100% of the originally calculated 1RM if the strength and conditioning professional is factoring in the athlete’s potential strength gains during training. Relative percents are especially useful during unloading weeks. They may vary as a result of strength testing, since the percent will be based on the new 1RM strength value.\\n\\nTraining within a RM zone requires an increase in repetitions with a current workload until a target number is reached. In a zone of 8- to 12RM, the athlete selects an 8RM load and performs 8 repetitions. During the next few workouts, the athlete performs additional repetitions with that load until 12 repetitions are completed on consecutive workouts. The training load is then increased, and the athlete subsequently performs 8 repetitions.\\n\\nIncreasing intensity in absolute amounts is most common, especially among assistance exercises and core structural exercises. For example, the athlete completes six repetitions with 100 kg in the bench press. As strength increases, the athlete continues to perform six repetitions; however, he uses a greater load (e.g., 105 kg). When the athlete feels (or appears) stronger, an absolute amount of weight can be added to the exercise. The absolute increase depends on the exercise, since a large muscle mass exercise (i.e., leg press) can tolerate an increase of 4 to 7 kg, while a small muscle mass exercise (i.e., biceps curl) may only tolerate an increase of 1 to 2 kg. All of these methods have been studied and shown to be very effective for resistance training. Ultimately, which method or combination of methods will be used is up to the preference of the athlete or strength and conditioning professional.', 'floor (Figure 4-62)\\n\\nthe chest (Figure 4-64)\\n\\n3.

Training volume can be manipulated by changing the number of exercises performed per session, the number of repetitions performed per set, or the number of sets per exercise. Typically, an inverse relationship exists between the number of sets per exercise and the number of exercises performed in a workout. There is also an inverse relationship between volume and intensity. That is, volume should be reduced if significant increases in intensity are prescribed. Strength training is associated with low to moderate training volume, since a low to moderate number of repetitions are performed per set for core structural exercises. Hypertrophy and muscular endurance training are associated with moderate to high intensity and volume. These programs, which are high in total work, tend to stimulate a potent endocrine and metabolic response.\\n\\nTraining volumes of athletes vary considerably and depend on other factors besides intensity (e.g., training status, number of muscle groups trained per workout, nutrition practices, practice and competition schedule). Current volume recommendations for strength training include one to three sets per exercise for novice lifters and two to six sets for intermediate and advanced lifters. Multiple sets should be used with systematic variation of volume and intensity for progression into intermediate and advanced training. Dramatic increases in volume are not recommended, since they may lead to overtraining. Further, not all exercises need to be performed with the same number of sets. The volume of each exercise is related to the program priorities (31).\\n\\nThe number of sets performed per exercise, muscle group worked, and overall structure of the workout is also of primary interest when designing a resistance training program. Few studies directly compare resistance training programs of varying total sets. Most volume studies compare single- and multiple-set training programs. One set of an exercise performed for 8 to 12 repetitions at an intentionally slow lifting velocity has been compared to both periodized and nonperiodized multiple-set programs. These studies have shown similar results in novice athletes regardless of program design (37), but some studies have shown multiple sets to be superior (5). Periodized, multiple-set programs were shown to be superior during progression to intermediate and advanced stages of training (20, 22, 32). One study showed strength reduction in trained women who switched to a\\n\\nsingle-set program (18). Regarding total sets per workout, one study that examined the current literature suggested that eight sets per muscle group yielded the most substantial effects (28). Most studies used two to six sets per exercise and found substantial strength increases in trained and untrained athletes (21). Typically, two to six sets per exercise are most common during resistance training, but both greater and lesser amounts have also been used successfully.'], 'messages': [AIMessage(content='### Monday – Upper Body Strength Focus\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Bench Press | 4 | 6–8 | Focus on progressive overload, keep form strict |\\n| Bent-Over Barbell Rows | 3 | 8–10 | Strengthen back for balanced press development |\\n| Overhead Dumbbell Press | 3 | 8–10 | Supports shoulder stability |\\n| Triceps Dips (assisted if needed) | 3 | 8–12 | Triceps strength for bench press support |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Tuesday – Lower Body Strength & Core\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Barbell Squats | 4 | 6–8 | Compound movement, focus on depth and form |\\n| Romanian Deadlifts | 3 | 8–10 | Hamstring and glute activation |\\n| Plank | 3 | 30–45s | Core stability, helps overall strength |\\n| Hanging Leg Raises | 3 | 10–12 | Improves core and hip mobility |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Thursday – Upper Body Assistance & Power\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Incline Bench Press | 3 | 8–10 | Targets upper chest and shoulders |\\n| Lat Pulldown | 3 | 8–10 | Strengthens lats for row and pull movements |\\n| Dumbbell Lateral Raises | 3 | 12–15 | Supports shoulder health |\\n| Triceps Rope Pushdowns | 3 | 10–12 | Isolate triceps, aids bench press lockout |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Friday – Full Body & Bench Press Focus\\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps/Duration | Notes |\\n|---|---:|---:|---|\\n| Deadlifts | 3 | 5–6 | Maximal strength development |\\n| Bench Press | 4 | 6–8 | Main focus for strength increase |\\n| Pull-Ups / Assisted Pull-Ups | 3 | 8–10 | Develop upper back and arm strength |\\n| Dumbbell Shrugs | 3 | 10–12 | Traps for shoulder stability and posture |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 480, 'prompt_tokens': 2668, 'total_tokens': 3148, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_368a354b49', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b57955c2-b41a-4eb4-b028-e7c1101a726d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2668, 'output_tokens': 480, 'total_tokens': 3148, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]} \n",

To make an exercise more challenging in the gym, one simply lifts heavier weights. At home, and with little or no equipment, the exercises themselves must become more challenging.\\n\\nThis guide is designed to help you build or maintain strength without equipment while away at home. Herein are weekly workouts for those that wish to train 2, 4, or 6 times each week. Each of these programs includes ways to make the exercises harder or easier depending on your fitness levels and goals.\\n\\nIn addition to this strength program, aerobic exercise is necessary for maintaining good health as well as helping stay fit and de-stress while we’re all at home. See the following pages and select the workout that is most appropriate for you. Above all, listen to your body and use your best judgement when approaching an exercise program on your own.\\n\\nBecause of copyright, all images and videos are linked to the original source online rather than embedded in this guide.

The athlete is required to use the same relative intensity during each resistance training session. However, some variability to training volume is to be expected, since the number of repetitions per training session may differ to account for recovery from the preceding training session. In following with the progressive overload principle, once the athlete can achieve the desired training goal (e.g., maximum number of repetitions per session), the resistance can be elevated during the next training session. Although the relative intensity remains the same, training volume actually increases (load × number of repetitions). This is often called a traditional or classic periodization program and has been referred to in recent sport-science literature as linear periodization. However, chapter 11 discusses, there is a very good debate regarding the appropriateness of the linear term.\\n\\nAn alternative method of training uses a different loading scheme for each workout. This has been referred to as an undulating or nonlinear periodization program (9). Table 12.3 provides an example of a three-day nonlinear training\\n\\nprogram that may be considered for athletes in the off-season. However, it is important to note that recent research has suggested that the traditional periodized training model may be more effective during short-term (~15 weeks), off-season training programs for collegiate strength/ power athletes (8). An additional concern for strength and conditioning professionals developing off-season training programs is the experience level of their athletes. For the more experienced resistance-trained athlete, it appears that the inclusion of assistance exercises (e.g., inclined bench press, inclined fly) is important for providing the necessary training stimulus (7).', 'Lifting Warm-up\\n\\nBB Rack Shrug OR Rack Jump OR Rack Clean\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB High Pull\\n\\n2x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\n3x5\\n\\nBB Standing Shoulder Press
