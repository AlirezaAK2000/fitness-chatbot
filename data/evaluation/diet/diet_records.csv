The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Summary\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\n\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\n\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview

Let me know if you want recipes or substitutions for any meals!","['Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for all 12 calorie levels of the patterns. [b] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3. [c] Vegetarian patterns include 1½ cups per week of legumes as a vegetable subgroup, and an additional 6 oz-eq (1½ cups) per week of legumes as a protein food. The total amount is shown here as legumes in the vegetable group.\n\nA Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern (Appendix 4) was designed by modifying the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating\n\n[d] The FDA and EPA provide additional guidance regarding seafood consumption for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children.

Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2002.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\nPage 35 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nPattern, taking into account food group intakes from studies examining the associations between Mediterranean- Style eating patterns and health.\n\nThe Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than does the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern. The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\n\nFocus on whole fruits.\n\nFruits\n\nMake half your grains whole grains.\n\nDairy\n\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\n\nVary your veggies.\n\nVegetables\n\nProtein\n\nVary your protein routine.\n\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\n\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\n\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\n\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n3,200\n\nFood Group[b]\n\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\n\nVegetables\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7½\n\n7½\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n½\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2\n\n3½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n1½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n7\n\n7\n\nFruits\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\nGrains\n\n3 oz-eq\n\n4 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n7 oz-eq\n\n8 oz-eq\n\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\n\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRefined Grains (oz\xad eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 80\n\nTable A3-1.

This plan should support your goal of maintaining weight with a balanced, nutrient-dense, lean-protein and vegetable-focused meal plan around 1600 calories per day. Let me know if you'd like recipes for other meals or any substitutions!","['Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\n\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\n\nHOME\n\nMeal Planning', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Summary\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\n\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\n\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n3,200\n\nFood Group[b]\n\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\n\nVegetables\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7½\n\n7½\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n½\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2\n\n3½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n1½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n7\n\n7\n\nFruits\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\nGrains\n\n3 oz-eq\n\n4 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n7 oz-eq\n\n8 oz-eq\n\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\n\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRefined Grains (oz\xad eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 80\n\nTable A3-1.

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', '2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page xi\n\nThe Guidelines\n\n1\n\n1.

This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\n\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.']","# Meal Plan Overview

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2002.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\nPage 35 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nPattern, taking into account food group intakes from studies examining the associations between Mediterranean- Style eating patterns and health.\n\nThe Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than does the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern. The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Appendix 13.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

This meal plan supports your preference for high-protein with controlled carbs and fats while emphasizing lean meats, vegetables, and healthy fats, tailored approximately for 2600 kcal/day.","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n3,200\n\nFood Group[b]\n\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\n\nVegetables\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7½\n\n7½\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n½\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2\n\n3½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n1½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n7\n\n7\n\nFruits\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\nGrains\n\n3 oz-eq\n\n4 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n7 oz-eq\n\n8 oz-eq\n\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\n\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRefined Grains (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 84\n\nTable A4-1.

Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.']","# Meal Plan Overview

Let me know if you'd like recipes for other meals or substitutions!","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\n\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'Appendix 13.

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\n\nFocus on whole fruits.\n\nFruits\n\nMake half your grains whole grains.\n\nDairy\n\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\n\nVary your veggies.\n\nVegetables\n\nProtein\n\nVary your protein routine.\n\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\n\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\n\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\n\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy. Visit ChooseMyPlate.gov for more tips, tools, and information.\n\nPage 69 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 3\n\nFigure 3-3. Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\n\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\n\nHOME\n\nMeal Planning']","# Meal Plan Overview

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Calorie Level of Pattern[a]\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n3,200\n\nFood Group[b]\n\nDaily Amount[c] of Food From Each Group (vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week)\n\nVegetables\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq 1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3½ c-eq 3½ c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\n4 c-eq\n\nDark-Green Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\nRed & Orange Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7½\n\n7½\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas) (c-eq/wk)\n\n½\n\n½\n\n½\n\n1\n\n1½\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\nStarchy Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n2\n\n3½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\nOther Vegetables (c-eq/wk)\n\n1½\n\n2½\n\n2½\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5½\n\n5½\n\n7\n\n7\n\nFruits\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1 c-eq\n\n1½ c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2 c-eq\n\n2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq 2½ c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\n3 c-eq\n\nGrains\n\n3 oz-eq\n\n4 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n5 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n6 oz-eq\n\n7 oz-eq\n\n8 oz-eq\n\n9 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq 10 oz-eq\n\nWhole Grains[d] (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nRefined Grains (oz-eq/day)\n\n1½\n\n2\n\n2½\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3½\n\n4\n\n4½\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 84\n\nTable A4-1.

If you want me to adjust the plan for specific calorie targets or particular food preferences, just let me know!","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\n\nFocus on whole fruits.\n\nFruits\n\nMake half your grains whole grains.\n\nDairy\n\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\n\nVary your veggies.\n\nVegetables\n\nProtein\n\nVary your protein routine.\n\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\n\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\n\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\n\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy. Visit ChooseMyPlate.gov for more tips, tools, and information.\n\nPage 69 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 3\n\nFigure 3-3. Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\n\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\n\nHOME\n\nMeal Planning']","# Meal Plan Overview

(continued...) Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', '27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)\n\n[e]\n\n260 kcal/day (13%)\n\n290 kcal/day (15%)\n\n[a] Food group amounts shown in cup- (c) or ounce- (oz) equivalents (eq).

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce.

This plan supports your goal of high-protein, low-carb intake with around 950 kcal/day, offering balanced macros and variety. Let me know if you want recipes for any other meals or snack ideas!","['Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Males\n\nFemales[d]\n\nAge\n\nSedentary[a]\n\nModerately Active[b]\n\nActive[c]\n\nAge\n\nSedentary[a]\n\nModerately Active[b]\n\nActive[c]\n\n2\n\n1,000\n\n1,000\n\n1,000\n\n2\n\n1,000\n\n1,000\n\n1,000\n\n3\n\n1,000\n\n1,400\n\n1,400\n\n3\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n4\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n4\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,400\n\n5\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n5\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n6\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n6\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n7\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n7\n\n1,200\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n8\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n2,000\n\n8\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\nPage 77 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMales\n\nFemales[d]\n\nAge\n\nSedentary[a]\n\nModerately Active[b]\n\nActive[c]\n\nAge\n\nSedentary[a]\n\nModerately Active[b]\n\nActive[c]\n\n9\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n9\n\n1,400\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n10\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,200\n\n10\n\n1,400\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n11\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n11\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n12\n\n1,800\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n12\n\n1,600\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n13\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,600\n\n13\n\n1,600\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n14\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n14\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n15\n\n2,200\n\n2,600\n\n3,000\n\n15\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n16\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n3,200\n\n16\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n17\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n3,200\n\n17\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n18\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n3,200\n\n18\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n19-20\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n19-20\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n21-25\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n3,000\n\n21-25\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n26-30\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n3,000\n\n26-30\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n31-35\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n3,000\n\n31-35\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n36-40\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n36-40\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n41-45\n\n2,200\n\n2,600\n\n2,800\n\n41-45\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n46-50\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n46-50\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n51-55\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,800\n\n51-55\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,200\n\n56-60\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n56-60\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,200\n\n61-65\n\n2,000\n\n2,400\n\n2,600\n\n61-65\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n66-70\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,600\n\n66-70\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n71-75\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,600\n\n71-75\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n76 & Up\n\n2,000\n\n2,200\n\n2,400\n\n76 & Up\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n2,000\n\n[a] Sedentary means a lifestyle that includes only the physical activity of independent living.\n\n[b] Moderately Active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the activities of independent living.\n\n[c] Active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the activities of independent living.\n\n[d] Estimates for females do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nSOURCE: Institute of Medicine.

This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview

Please let me know if you want adjustments such as vegetarian options, different calorie targets, or specific food preferences!","['Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'A healthy eating pattern limits:\n\nSaturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium\n\nKey Recommendations that are quantitative are provided for several components of the diet that should be limited. These components are of particular public health concern in the United States, and the specified limits can help individuals achieve healthy eating patterns within calorie limits:\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars[2]\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats[3]\n\nConsume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day of sodium[4]\n\nIf alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation—up to one drink per day for women and\n\nup to two drinks per day for men—and only by adults of legal drinking age.[5]\n\nIn tandem with the recommendations above, Americans of all ages—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—should meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Americans should aim to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. The relationship between diet and physical activity contributes to calorie balance and managing body weight. As such, the Dietary Guidelines includes a Key Recommendation to:\n\nMeet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.[6]\n\n[1] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout Chapter 1: Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and are compiled in Appendix 3. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern.\n\n[2] The recommendation to limit intake of calories from added sugars to less than 10 percent per day is a target based on food pattern modeling and national data on intakes of calories from added sugars that demonstrate the public health need to limit calories from added sugars to meet food group and nutrient needs within calorie limits. The limit on calories from added sugars is not a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). For most calorie levels, there are not enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits.\n\n[3] The recommendation to limit intake of calories from saturated fats to less than 10 percent per day is a target based on evidence that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The limit on calories from saturated fats is not a UL set by the IOM. For most calorie levels, there are not enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits.\n\n[4] The recommendation to limit intake of sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day is the UL for individuals ages 14 years and older set by the IOM. The recommendations for children younger than 14 years of age are the IOM age- and sex-appropriate ULs (see Appendix 7. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations).\n\n[5] It is not recommended that individuals begin drinking or drink more for any reason. The amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies and should be accounted for within the limits of healthy eating patterns. Alcohol should be consumed only by adults of legal drinking age. There are many circumstances in which individuals should not drink, such as during pregnancy. See Appendix 9. Alcohol for additional information.\n\n[6] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Summary\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\n\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\n\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\n\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Key Recommendations:\n\nConsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\n\nA healthy eating pattern includes:[1]\n\nA variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy,\n\nand other\n\nFruits, especially whole fruits\n\nGrains, at least half of which are whole grains\n\nFat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\n\nA variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,\n\nseeds, and soy products\n\nOils', 'Spaghetti Sauce\n\n¼ cup\n\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\n\n¼ cup\n\nMeatballs\n\n3 medium meatballs\n\nParmesan Cheese\n\n1 tablespoon\n\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\n\nContributes: Saturated Fats\n\nAdded Sugars\n\nDinner\n\nApple, Raw ½ medium\n\nWater, Tap 1 cup\n\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\n\nCucumber\n\n1 cup\n\n3 slices\n\nAvocado\n\n¼ cup, cubed\n\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\n\n¼ cup\n\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\n\n3 tablespoons, shredded\n\nRanch Salad Dressing\n\n1 tablespoon\n\n761 Calories\n\nTotal\n\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\n\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'About Legumes (Beans & Peas)\n\nLegumes include kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, garbanzo beans (chickpeas), lima beans (mature, dried), split peas, lentils, and edamame (green soybeans).\n\nLegumes are excellent sources of protein. In addition, they provide other nutrients that also are found in seafood, meats, and poultry, such as iron and zinc. They are excellent sources of dietary fiber and of nutrients, such as potassium and folate that also are found in other vegetables.\n\nBecause legumes have a similar nutrient profile to foods in both the protein foods group and the vegetable group, they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food and thus, can be counted as a vegetable or a protein food to meet recommended intakes.\n\nGreen peas and green (string) beans are not counted in the legume subgroup, because their nutrient compositions are not similar to legumes. Green peas are similar to starchy vegetables and are grouped with them. Green beans are grouped with the other vegetables subgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce, celery, and cabbage, because their nutrient content is not similar to legumes.\n\nand orange vegetables the most vitamin A, legumes the most dietary fiber, and starchy vegetables the most potassium. Vegetables in the “other” vegetable subgroup provide a wide range of nutrients in varying amounts.\n\nConsiderations: To provide all of the nutrients and potential health benefits that vary across different types of vegetables, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for each subgroup. Vegetable choices over time should vary and include many different vegetables. Vegetables should be consumed in a nutrient-dense form, with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy sauces. When selecting frozen or canned vegetables, choose those lower in sodium.\n\nand 100% fruit juice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. The recommended amount of fruits in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2 cup-equivalents per day. One cup of 100% fruit juice counts as 1 cup of fruit. Although fruit juice can be part of healthy eating patterns, it is lower than whole fruit in dietary fiber and when consumed in excess can contribute extra calories. Therefore, at least half of the recommended amount of fruits should come from whole fruits. When juices are consumed, they should be 100% juice, without added sugars. Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options that are lowest in added sugars. One-half cup of dried fruit counts as one cup-equivalent of fruit. Similar to juice, when consumed in excess, dried fruits can contribute extra calories.']","# Meal Plan Overview

This plan provides a balanced, sustainable approach to low-carb, high-protein eating focused on lean meats and vegetables within ~1500 kcal daily. Let me know if you'd like recipes for any other meals or adjustments!","['Key Recommendations:\n\nConsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\n\nA healthy eating pattern includes:[1]\n\nA variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy,\n\nand other\n\nFruits, especially whole fruits\n\nGrains, at least half of which are whole grains\n\nFat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\n\nA variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,\n\nseeds, and soy products\n\nOils', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq). Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\n\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Appendix 13.

This meal plan and grocery list provide a high-protein, low-carb, moderate-fat diet aligned with your active lifestyle for weight maintenance with nutrient-dense foods and variety to keep it enjoyable and sustainable.","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\n\nFocus on whole fruits.\n\nFruits\n\nMake half your grains whole grains.\n\nDairy\n\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\n\nVary your veggies.\n\nVegetables\n\nProtein\n\nVary your protein routine.\n\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\n\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\n\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\n\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\n\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\n\nHOME\n\nMeal Planning', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'A healthy eating pattern limits:\n\nSaturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium\n\nKey Recommendations that are quantitative are provided for several components of the diet that should be limited. These components are of particular public health concern in the United States, and the specified limits can help individuals achieve healthy eating patterns within calorie limits:\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars[2]\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats[3]\n\nConsume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day of sodium[4]\n\nIf alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation—up to one drink per day for women and\n\nup to two drinks per day for men—and only by adults of legal drinking age.[5]\n\nIn tandem with the recommendations above, Americans of all ages—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—should meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Americans should aim to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. The relationship between diet and physical activity contributes to calorie balance and managing body weight. As such, the Dietary Guidelines includes a Key Recommendation to:\n\nMeet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.[6]\n\n[1] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout Chapter 1: Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and are compiled in Appendix 3.

The limit on calories from added sugars is not a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). For most calorie levels, there are not enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits.\n\n[3] The recommendation to limit intake of calories from saturated fats to less than 10 percent per day is a target based on evidence that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.

The recommendations for children younger than 14 years of age are the IOM age- and sex-appropriate ULs (see Appendix 7. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations).\n\n[5] It is not recommended that individuals begin drinking or drink more for any reason. The amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies and should be accounted for within the limits of healthy eating patterns. Alcohol should be consumed only by adults of legal drinking age.

Alcohol for additional information.\n\nPage 15 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1', 'Over the past century, deficiencies\n\nof essential nutrients have dramatically decreased, many infectious diseases have been conquered, and the majority of the U.S. population can now anticipate a long and productive life. At the same time, rates of chronic diseases—many of which are related to poor quality diet and physical inactivity—have increased. About half of all American adults have one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n\nHowever, a large body of evidence now shows that healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of the lifespan. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects this evidence through its recommendations.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines is required under the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, which states that every 5 years, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture (USDA) must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. The statute (Public Law 101-445, 7 U.S.C. 5341 et seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be\n\nbased on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. The 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds from the 2010 edition with revisions based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of Federal agency and public comments.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet. The information in the Dietary Guidelines is used in developing Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of HHS and USDA food programs. It is developed for use by policymakers and nutrition and health professionals. Additional audiences who may use Dietary Guidelines information to develop programs, policies, and communication for the general public include businesses, schools, community groups, media, the food industry, and State and local governments.\n\nPrevious editions of the Dietary Guidelines focused primarily on individual dietary components such as food groups and nutrients. However, people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the\n\ndiet forms an overall eating pattern. The components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health. These patterns can be tailored to an individual’s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices. These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget. Several examples of healthy eating patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.']","# Meal Plan Overview

However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Key Recommendations:\n\nConsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\n\nA healthy eating pattern includes:[1]\n\nA variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy,\n\nand other\n\nFruits, especially whole fruits\n\nGrains, at least half of which are whole grains\n\nFat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\n\nA variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,\n\nseeds, and soy products\n\nOils', 'Importance of Calorie Balance Within Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance—the balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from metabolic processes and physical activity. The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC).

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fifth Guideline:\n\n1.

The best way to determine whether an eating pattern is at an appropriate number of calories is to monitor body weight and adjust calorie intake and expenditure in physical activity based on changes in weight over time.\n\nAll foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on the macronutrients in a food. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors, including the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity (see Appendix 2). In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed.\n\nAll Americans—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—are encouraged to achieve and/or maintain a healthy body weight. General guidance for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is provided below, and Appendix 8. Federal Resources for Information on Nutrition and Physical Activity provides additional resources, including an evolving array of tools to facilitate Americans’ adoption of healthy choices.\n\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to maintain calorie balance to support normal growth and\n\ndevelopment without promoting excess weight gain. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to maintain or reduce their rate of weight gain while linear growth occurs, so that they can reduce body mass index (BMI) percentile toward a healthy range.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, women are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and\n\nwomen who are pregnant are encouraged to gain weight within gestational weight gain guidelines.[8]\n\nAdults who are obese should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent additional weight gain and/or promote weight loss. Adults who are overweight should not gain additional weight, and those with one or more CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia) should change their eating and physical activity behaviors to lose weight. To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase their physical activity. For a weight loss of 1 to 1½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating patterns that contain 1,200 to 1,500 calories each day can help most women lose weight safely, and eating patterns that contain 1,500 to 1,800 calories each day are suitable for most men for weight loss. In adults who are overweight or obese, if reduction in total calorie intake is achieved, a variety of eating patterns can produce weight loss, particularly in the first 6 months to 2 years;[9] however, more research is needed on the health implications of consuming these eating patterns long-term.\n\nOlder adults, ages 65 years and older, who are overweight or obese are encouraged to prevent additional\n\nweight gain. Among older adults who are obese, particularly those with CVD risk factors, intentional weight loss can be beneficial and result in improved quality of life and reduced risk of chronic diseases and associated disabilities.\n\n[8] Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC). Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2009.', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.']","# Meal Plan Overview

This plan balances your preferences, intermittent fasting timing, and a high-protein vegetarian profile with diverse whole foods. Let me know if you want recipes for any other meals or substitutions!","['About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6. Average Protein Foods Subgroup Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Week by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Intake', 'Summary\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides Guidelines and Key Recommendations with clear guidance for individuals to enhance eating and physical activity patterns. Implementation of these Guidelines will help promote health and prevent chronic disease in the United States. At the core of this guidance is the importance of consuming overall healthy eating patterns, including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods, and oils—eaten within an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Examples of how to put this guidance into practice are provided by the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern and its two variations, a Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and a Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 36\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nShifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns\n\nPage 37 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nF ollowing healthy eating patterns is\n\nvital to health. This chapter provides a snapshot of current eating patterns of\n\npeople in the United States in comparison to the recommendations in Chapter 1. Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and describes shifts that are needed to align current intakes to recommendations. In some cases, the news is good—for certain aspects of eating patterns, some individuals are following the guidance or are close to meeting the recommendations. However, other aspects of the diet are far from the recommendations. Most Americans would benefit from shifting food choices both within and across food groups and from current food choices to nutrient-dense choices. Some shifts that are needed are minor and can be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while others will require greater effort to accomplish.', 'Source of Goal[a]\n\nChild 1-3\n\nFemale 4-8\n\nMale 4-8\n\nFemale 9-13\n\nMale 9-13\n\nFemale 14-18\n\nMale 14-18\n\nFemale 19-30\n\nCalorie Level(s) Assessed\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400, 1,600\n\n1,600\n\n1,800\n\n1,800\n\n2,200, 2,800, 3,200\n\n2,000\n\nMacronutrients\n\nProtein, g\n\nRDA\n\n13\n\n19\n\n19\n\n34\n\n34\n\n46\n\n52\n\n46\n\nProtein, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n5-20\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n\n10-35\n\nCarbohydrate, g\n\nRDA\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\nCarbohydrate, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\n45-65\n\nDietary Fiber, g\n\n14 g/ 1,000 kcal\n\n14\n\n16.8\n\n19.6\n\n22.4\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n30.8\n\n28\n\nAdded Sugars, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nTotal Fat, % kcal\n\nAMDR\n\n30-40\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n25-35\n\n20-35\n\nSaturated Fat, % kcal\n\nDGA\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\n<10%\n\nLinoleic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n11\n\n16\n\n12\n\nLinolenic Acid, g\n\nAI\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\nPage 97 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nMale 19-30\n\n2,400, 2,600, 3,000\n\n56\n\n10-35\n\n130\n\n45-65\n\n33.6\n\n<10%\n\n20-35\n\n<10%\n\n17\n\n1.6']","# Meal Plan Overview

This 7-day meal plan offers a variety of delicious, protein-rich vegetarian meals incorporating both dairy and plant-based sources to meet your nutritional targets while staying around 2100 calories per day. Let me know if you want recipes adjusted for allergies or specific tastes!","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1. Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', '27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)\n\n[e]\n\n260 kcal/day (13%)\n\n290 kcal/day (15%)\n\n[a] Food group amounts shown in cup- (c) or ounce- (oz) equivalents (eq). Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for all 12 calorie levels of the patterns. [b] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3. [c] Vegetarian patterns include 1½ cups per week of legumes as a vegetable subgroup, and an additional 6 oz-eq (1½ cups) per week of legumes as a protein food. The total amount is shown here as legumes in the vegetable group.\n\nA Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern (Appendix 4) was designed by modifying the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating\n\n[d] The FDA and EPA provide additional guidance regarding seafood consumption for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children. For more information, see the FDA or EPA websites www.FDA.gov/ fishadvice; www.EPA.gov/fishadvice.\n\n[e] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, solid fats, added refined starches, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient- dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\n[30] Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2002.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\nPage 35 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nPattern, taking into account food group intakes from studies examining the associations between Mediterranean- Style eating patterns and health.\n\nThe Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than does the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern. The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'Appendix 13.

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Spaghetti Sauce\n\n¼ cup\n\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\n\n¼ cup\n\nMeatballs\n\n3 medium meatballs\n\nParmesan Cheese\n\n1 tablespoon\n\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\n\nContributes: Saturated Fats\n\nAdded Sugars\n\nDinner\n\nApple, Raw ½ medium\n\nWater, Tap 1 cup\n\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\n\nCucumber\n\n1 cup\n\n3 slices\n\nAvocado\n\n¼ cup, cubed\n\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\n\n¼ cup\n\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\n\n3 tablespoons, shredded\n\nRanch Salad Dressing\n\n1 tablespoon\n\n761 Calories\n\nTotal\n\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\n\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1. Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6.

Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for all 12 calorie levels of the patterns. [b] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3. [c] Vegetarian patterns include 1½ cups per week of legumes as a vegetable subgroup, and an additional 6 oz-eq (1½ cups) per week of legumes as a protein food. The total amount is shown here as legumes in the vegetable group.\n\nA Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern (Appendix 4) was designed by modifying the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating\n\n[d] The FDA and EPA provide additional guidance regarding seafood consumption for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children.

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Key Recommendations:\n\nConsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\n\nA healthy eating pattern includes:[1]\n\nA variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy,\n\nand other\n\nFruits, especially whole fruits\n\nGrains, at least half of which are whole grains\n\nFat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\n\nA variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,\n\nseeds, and soy products\n\nOils', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1.

See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\n\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'About Legumes (Beans & Peas)\n\nLegumes include kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, garbanzo beans (chickpeas), lima beans (mature, dried), split peas, lentils, and edamame (green soybeans).\n\nLegumes are excellent sources of protein. In addition, they provide other nutrients that also are found in seafood, meats, and poultry, such as iron and zinc. They are excellent sources of dietary fiber and of nutrients, such as potassium and folate that also are found in other vegetables.\n\nBecause legumes have a similar nutrient profile to foods in both the protein foods group and the vegetable group, they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food and thus, can be counted as a vegetable or a protein food to meet recommended intakes.\n\nGreen peas and green (string) beans are not counted in the legume subgroup, because their nutrient compositions are not similar to legumes. Green peas are similar to starchy vegetables and are grouped with them. Green beans are grouped with the other vegetables subgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce, celery, and cabbage, because their nutrient content is not similar to legumes.\n\nand orange vegetables the most vitamin A, legumes the most dietary fiber, and starchy vegetables the most potassium. Vegetables in the “other” vegetable subgroup provide a wide range of nutrients in varying amounts.\n\nConsiderations: To provide all of the nutrients and potential health benefits that vary across different types of vegetables, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for each subgroup. Vegetable choices over time should vary and include many different vegetables. Vegetables should be consumed in a nutrient-dense form, with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy sauces. When selecting frozen or canned vegetables, choose those lower in sodium.\n\nand 100% fruit juice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. The recommended amount of fruits in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2 cup-equivalents per day. One cup of 100% fruit juice counts as 1 cup of fruit. Although fruit juice can be part of healthy eating patterns, it is lower than whole fruit in dietary fiber and when consumed in excess can contribute extra calories. Therefore, at least half of the recommended amount of fruits should come from whole fruits. When juices are consumed, they should be 100% juice, without added sugars. Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options that are lowest in added sugars. One-half cup of dried fruit counts as one cup-equivalent of fruit. Similar to juice, when consumed in excess, dried fruits can contribute extra calories.', '27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)\n\n[e]\n\n260 kcal/day (13%)\n\n290 kcal/day (15%)\n\n[a] Food group amounts shown in cup- (c) or ounce- (oz) equivalents (eq). Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for all 12 calorie levels of the patterns. [b] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3. [c] Vegetarian patterns include 1½ cups per week of legumes as a vegetable subgroup, and an additional 6 oz-eq (1½ cups) per week of legumes as a protein food. The total amount is shown here as legumes in the vegetable group.\n\nA Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern (Appendix 4) was designed by modifying the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating\n\n[d] The FDA and EPA provide additional guidance regarding seafood consumption for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children. For more information, see the FDA or EPA websites www.FDA.gov/ fishadvice; www.EPA.gov/fishadvice.\n\n[e] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, solid fats, added refined starches, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient- dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\n[30] Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2002.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\nPage 35 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nPattern, taking into account food group intakes from studies examining the associations between Mediterranean- Style eating patterns and health.\n\nThe Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than does the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern. The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1.

This plan provides a balance of varied plant-based proteins, dairy, and eggs, hitting your target calories and protein goals with daily supplementation to optimize your vegetarian diet. If you want recipes or alternatives for any day, just ask!","['Protein Foods\n\nHealthy Intake: Healthy eating patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1. Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'Protein Foods\n\nCurrent Intakes: Overall, average intakes of protein foods are close to amounts recommended for all age-sex groups (Figure 2-3). However, Figure 2-6 shows that the average intakes of protein foods subgroups vary in comparison to the range of intake recommendations. Overall, average intakes of seafood are low for all age-sex groups; average intakes of nuts, seeds, and soy products are close to recommended levels; and\n\naverage intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs are high for teen boys and adult men. Legumes (beans and peas), a vegetables subgroup, also may be considered as part of the protein foods group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box in Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 2-4, intakes of legumes are below vegetable group recommendations.\n\nCommonly consumed protein foods include beef (especially ground beef), chicken, pork, processed meats (e.g., hot dogs,\n\nsausages, ham, luncheon meats), and eggs. The most common seafood choices are shrimp, tuna, and salmon; and the most common nut choices are peanuts, peanut butter, almonds, and mixed nuts. Slightly less than half (49%) of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish (45%), with the largest amount from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos.\n\nFigure 2-6.

Food Safety Principles and Guidance.\n\nPage 11 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Introduction\n\nA Roadmap to the 2015-2020 Edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n\nPeople do not eat foods and nutrients in isolation but in combination, and this combination forms an overall eating pattern. A growing body of research has examined the relationship between overall eating patterns, health, and risk of chronic disease, and findings on these relationships are sufficiently well established to support dietary guidance. As a result, eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics are a primary emphasis of the recommendations in this 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines. This edition of the Dietary Guidelines consists of this Introduction, three chapters, and 14 appendixes:\n\nChapter 1. Key Elements of\n\nHealthy Eating Patterns discusses the relationship of diet and physical activity to health over the lifespan and explains the principles of a healthy eating pattern. The chapter provides quantitative recommendations for a Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level as an example to show how individuals can follow these principles and recommendations. It also includes two variations at the same 2,000-calorie level as examples of other healthy eating patterns individuals can choose based on personal preference: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Chapter 1 focuses on the first three Guidelines and the Key Recommendations.\n\nChapter 2. Shifts Needed To Align With Healthy Eating Patterns compares current food and nutrient intakes in the United States to recommendations and describes the shifts in dietary choices that are needed to align current intakes with recommendations. Chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Guideline.\n\nChapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in\n\nSupporting Healthy Eating Patterns explains how all individuals and segments of society in the\n\nUnited States have an important role to play in supporting healthy eating and physical activity choices. It outlines a variety of strategies and actions that align with the Dietary Guidelines. Chapter 3 focuses on the fifth Guideline.\n\nThe Appendixes provide additional\n\ninformation to support the content of the chapters, including recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans; calorie needs by age, sex, and level\n\nof physical activity; the base Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern; two other examples of healthy eating patterns: the Healthy Mediterranean-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Eating Patterns; a glossary of terms; and nutritional goals for various age-sex groups. The Appendixes also include a list of selected Government resources on diet and physical activity; additional information on alcohol; lists of food sources of nutrients of public health concern; and food safety principles and guidance.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods\n\nPage 23 — 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1\n\nfrom both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Legumes (beans and peas) may also be considered part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetables group (see the About Legumes (Beans and Peas) call-out box). Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (e.g., dairy). The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce- equivalents of protein foods per day.\n\nKey Nutrient Contributions: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B vitamins (e.g., niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E). Nutrients provided by various types of protein foods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin. Meats, poultry, and seafood provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron found in plant sources. Heme iron is especially important for young children and women who are capable of becoming pregnant or who are pregnant. Seafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to almost all of the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the Patterns (see the About Seafood call-out box). Eggs provide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source of copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\n\nConsiderations: For balance and flexibility within the food group, the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Eating Pattern includes weekly recommendations for the subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. A specific\n\nrecommendation for at least 8 ounce- equivalents of seafood per week also is included for the 2,000-calorie level (see the About Seafood call-out box). One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein foods, and because they are high in calories, they should be eaten in small portions\n\nand used to replace other protein foods rather than being added to the diet. When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and poultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of sodium and saturated fats, and intake of these products can\n\nbe accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern (see the About Meats and Poultry call-out box). The inclusion of protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.', 'Appendix 5. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern\n\nThe Healthy Vegetarian Pattern is adapted from the Healthy U.S.\xad Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups to more closely reflect eating patterns reported by self-identified vegetarians in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This analysis allowed development of a Pattern that is based on evidence of the foods and amounts consumed by vegetarians, in addition to meeting the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern. Based on a comparison of the food choices of these vegetarians to nonvegetarians in NHANES, amounts of soy products (particularly tofu and\n\nother processed soy products), legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains were increased, and meat, poultry, and seafood were eliminated. Dairy and eggs were included because they were consumed by the majority of these vegetarians. This Pattern can be vegan if all dairy choices are comprised of fortified soy beverages (soymilk) or other plant-based dairy substitutes. Note that vegetarian adaptations of the USDA Food Patterns were included in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. However, those adaptations did not modify the underlying structure of the Patterns, but substituted the same amounts of plant foods for animal foods in each food group. In contrast, the current\n\nHealthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts, based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians. The Pattern is similar in meeting nutrient standards to the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, but somewhat higher in calcium and fiber and lower in vitamin D due to differences in the foods included.\n\nTo follow this Pattern, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — Page 86\n\nTable A5-1.

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Figure ES-1. 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans at a Glance\n\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines focuses on the big picture with recommendations to help Americans make choices that add up to an overall healthy eating pattern. To build a healthy eating pattern, combine healthy choices from across all food groups—while paying attention to calorie limits, too.

- Calories (average per day): 2000 kcal  
- Protein (average per day): 160 g  
- Carbs (average per day): 75 g  
- Fat (average per day): 110 g  
- Fiber (average per day): 25 g  
- Notes:  
  This plan follows a Paleo, High Protein, and Low Carb approach tailored for intermittent fasting. Meals are designed to fit a feeding window (e.g., 12 PM to 8 PM), with 2 main meals and 1-2 snacks per day primarily consumed in that timeframe. The focus is on high protein intake from meats, fish, and eggs, ample healthy fats from nuts, seeds, and oils, and limited low GI carbs from fibrous vegetables and some fruits. Total calories are moderate to support maintenance or mild fat loss for an active 80 kg male.

Strategies To Align Settings With the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines\n\nAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices—it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together.\n\nHOME\n\nMeal Planning', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq). Oils are shown in grams (g). Quantity equivalents for each food group are defined in Appendix 3. Amounts will vary for those who need less than 2,000 or more than 2,000 calories per day. See Appendix 3 for all 12 calorie levels of the pattern.\n\n[c] Assumes food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms. Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.']","# Meal Plan Overview

The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.

Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Make half your plate fruits & vegetables.\n\nFocus on whole fruits.\n\nFruits\n\nMake half your grains whole grains.\n\nDairy\n\nEverything you eat and drink over time matters.\n\nVary your veggies.\n\nVegetables\n\nProtein\n\nVary your protein routine.\n\nMove to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt.\n\nThe right mix can help you be healthier in the future.\n\nDrink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.\n\nStart with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.

Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview

(continued...) Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels', 'About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Spaghetti Sauce\n\n¼ cup\n\nDiced Tomatoes (canned, no salt added)\n\n¼ cup\n\nMeatballs\n\n3 medium meatballs\n\nParmesan Cheese\n\n1 tablespoon\n\nSodium: 2,253 mg less than or equal to 2,300 mg\n\nContributes: Saturated Fats\n\nAdded Sugars\n\nDinner\n\nApple, Raw ½ medium\n\nWater, Tap 1 cup\n\nGarden Salad Mixed Greens\n\nCucumber\n\n1 cup\n\n3 slices\n\nAvocado\n\n¼ cup, cubed\n\nGarbanzo Beans (canned, low sodium)\n\n¼ cup\n\nCheddar Cheese (reduced fat)\n\n3 tablespoons, shredded\n\nRanch Salad Dressing\n\n1 tablespoon\n\n761 Calories\n\nTotal\n\nCalories From Saturated Fats: 153 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories\n\nCalories From Added Sugars: 164 (8% of Total Calories) less than or equal to 10% of calories']","# Meal Plan Overview

Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'Food Groupa\n\nAmount[b] in the 2,000-Calorie-Level Pattern\n\nVegetables\n\n2½ c-eq/day\n\nDark Green\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nRed & Orange\n\n5½ c-eq/wk\n\nLegumes (Beans & Peas)\n\n1½ c-eq/wk\n\nStarchy\n\n5 c-eq/wk\n\nOther\n\n4 c-eq/wk\n\nFruits\n\n2 c-eq/day\n\nGrains\n\n6 oz-eq/day\n\nWhole Grains\n\n≥ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nRefined Grains\n\n≤ 3 oz-eq/day\n\nDairy\n\n3 c-eq/day\n\nProtein Foods\n\n5½ oz-eq/day\n\nSeafood\n\n8 oz-eq/wk\n\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs\n\n26 oz-eq/wk\n\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\n\n5 oz-eq/wk\n\nOils\n\n27 g/day\n\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (% of Calories)c\n\n270 kcal/day (14%)\n\n[a] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\n\n[b] Food group amounts shown in cup-(c) or ounce-(oz) equivalents (eq).

In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent.

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are lower because the amounts of dairy were decreased, as shown in Appendix 4, to more closely match data from studies of Mediterranean-Style eating patterns.']","# Meal Plan Overview

This plan should support your active lifestyle with high protein, very low carb, while fitting Paleo and intermittent fasting needs. Let me know if you want me to customize further!","['About This Chapter\n\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline:\n\n1. Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. All food and beverage choices matter. Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\n\n2. Focus on variety, nutrient density,\n\nand amount. To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts.\n\n3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake. Consume an\n\neating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns.\n\n4. Shift to healthier food and beverage choices. Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices. Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain.\n\n5. Support healthy eating patterns for all. Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities. The chapter includes quantitative information on intakes and common sources of food groups, their subgroups, and other dietary components, including nutrients. The chapter also includes strategies to help shift current eating patterns toward the healthy patterns described in Chapter 1. Complementary strategies to support individuals in their effort to make shifts are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Everyone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns.\n\nMore than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations, but, as discussed later in the chapter, are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.\n\nMost Americans exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the eating patterns of many are too high in calories. Calorie intake over time, in comparison to calorie needs, is best evaluated by measuring body weight status. The high percentage of the population that is overweight or obese suggests that many in the United States overconsume calories. As documented in the Introduction, Table I-1, more than two-thirds of all adults and nearly one- third of all children and youth in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n\nCurrent eating patterns can be moved toward healthier eating patterns by making shifts in food choices over time. Making these shifts can help support a healthy body weight, meet nutrient needs, and lessen the risk for chronic disease.', 'A healthy eating pattern limits:\n\nSaturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium\n\nKey Recommendations that are quantitative are provided for several components of the diet that should be limited. These components are of particular public health concern in the United States, and the specified limits can help individuals achieve healthy eating patterns within calorie limits:\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars[2]\n\nConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats[3]\n\nConsume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day of sodium[4]\n\nIf alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation—up to one drink per day for women and\n\nup to two drinks per day for men—and only by adults of legal drinking age.[5]\n\nIn tandem with the recommendations above, Americans of all ages—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—should meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Americans should aim to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. The relationship between diet and physical activity contributes to calorie balance and managing body weight. As such, the Dietary Guidelines includes a Key Recommendation to:\n\nMeet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.[6]\n\n[1] Definitions for each food group and subgroup are provided throughout Chapter 1: Key Elements of Healthy Eating Patterns and are compiled in Appendix 3. USDA Food Patterns: Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern.\n\n[2] The recommendation to limit intake of calories from added sugars to less than 10 percent per day is a target based on food pattern modeling and national data on intakes of calories from added sugars that demonstrate the public health need to limit calories from added sugars to meet food group and nutrient needs within calorie limits. The limit on calories from added sugars is not a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). For most calorie levels, there are not enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits.\n\n[3] The recommendation to limit intake of calories from saturated fats to less than 10 percent per day is a target based on evidence that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The limit on calories from saturated fats is not a UL set by the IOM. For most calorie levels, there are not enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits.\n\n[4] The recommendation to limit intake of sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day is the UL for individuals ages 14 years and older set by the IOM. The recommendations for children younger than 14 years of age are the IOM age- and sex-appropriate ULs (see Appendix 7. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations).\n\n[5] It is not recommended that individuals begin drinking or drink more for any reason. The amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies and should be accounted for within the limits of healthy eating patterns. Alcohol should be consumed only by adults of legal drinking age. There are many circumstances in which individuals should not drink, such as during pregnancy. See Appendix 9. Alcohol for additional information.\n\n[6] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

The healthfulness of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern was evaluated based on its similarity to Mediterranean-Style patterns described in studies with positive health outcomes rather than on meeting specified nutrient standards. However, nutrient content of the Pattern was assessed and found to be similar to the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, except for calcium and vitamin D.

Calories from added sugars, added refined starches, solid fats, alcohol, and/or to eat more than the recommended amount of nutrient-dense foods are accounted for under this category.\n\nNOTE: The total eating pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for intake of calories from added sugars and saturated fats and alcohol and should be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for calories from protein, carbohydrate, and total fats. Most calorie patterns do not have enough calories available after meeting food group needs to consume 10 percent of calories from added sugars and 10 percent of calories from saturated fats and still stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.\n\n2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans • Chapter 1 — Page 18\n\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is designed to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)\n\nset by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. This eating pattern also conforms to limits set by the IOM or Dietary Guidelines for other nutrients or food components (see Appendix 6. Glossary of Terms and Appendix 7.\n\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups Based on Dietary Reference Intakes and Dietary Guidelines Recommendations). Nutritional goals for almost all nutrients are met (see Appendix 3 for additional information).\n\nFigure 1-1. Cup- & Ounce-Equivalents Within a food group, foods can come in many forms and are not created equal in terms of what counts as a cup or an ounce. Some foods are more concentrated, and some are more airy or contain more water. Cup- and ounce-equivalents identify the amounts of foods from each food group with similar nutritional content. In addition, portion sizes do not always align with one cup-equivalent or one ounce-equivalent. See examples below for variability.']","# Meal Plan Overview
- Calories (average per day): 2300 kcal  
- Protein (average per day): 170 g  
- Carbs (average per day): 120 g  
- Fat (average per day): 120 g  
- Fiber (average per day): 30 g  
- Notes:  
  This meal plan follows a Paleo, high-protein, intermittent fasting (16:8) approach. Meals are concentrated in an 8-hour window (e.g., 12:00 pm to 8:00 pm), with no breakfast, just lunch, dinner, and optional snacks. Carbs come mainly from vegetables and fruits to stay Paleo. Protein is prioritized to support active lifestyle and muscle maintenance. Healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil help energy requirements. Meals are varied to ensure micronutrient diversity and flavor.
