OVEN:
2
. 
Heat oven to 350°F (180°C) and position racks in top and bottom thirds. Wash potato (or potatoes)
thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water. Dry, then using a standard fork poke 8 to 12 deep
holes all over the spud so that moisture can escape during cooking. Place in a bowl and coat lightly with
oil. Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven. Place a baking sheet on
the lower rack to catch any drippings.
3
. 
Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft. Serve by creating a dotted line from end
to end with your fork, then crack the spud open by squeezing the ends towards one another. It will pop
right open. But watch out, there will be some steam.
4
. 
MICROWAVE:
5
. 
Scrub the potato, and prick several time with the tines of a fork. Place on a plate.
6
. 
Cook on full power in the microwave for 5 minutes. Turn over, and continue to cook for 5 more minutes.
When the potato is soft, remove from the microwave, and cut in half lengthwise.
7
. 
Top as desired, keeping in mind that some toppings (e.g. butter) will significantly increase the calories of
this dish, while others (e.g. salt, pepper, other seasonings) have little to no calories.

1 1/4 serving (38g)
protein powder
5/8 scoop (1/3 cup ea) (19g)
For all 2 meals:

Just find a cereal you like where a serving is in the 100-150 calorie range. Realistically, you could pick
any breakfast cereal and just scale the serving size to be in that range since pretty much all breakfast
cereals are going to have a very similar macronutrient breakdown. In other words, your choice of
breakfast cereal is not going to make or break your diet, since they're mostly all just a quick, high-
carbohydrate morning meal.

OVEN:

. 
Heat oven to 350 degrees
and position racks in top
and bottom thirds. Wash
potato (or potatoes)
thoroughly with a stiff
brush and cold running
water. Dry, then using a
standard fork poke 8 to 12
deep holes all over the
spud so that moisture can
escape during cooking.
Place in a bowl and coat
lightly with oil. Sprinkle
with kosher salt and place
potato directly on rack in
middle of oven. Place a
baking sheet on the lower
rack to catch any
drippings.
3
. 
Bake 1 hour or until skin
feels crisp but flesh
beneath feels soft. Serve
by creating a dotted line
from end to end with your
fork, then crack the spud
open by squeezing the
ends towards one another.
It will pop right open. But
watch out, there will be
some steam.
