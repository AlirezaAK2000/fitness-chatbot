### Overview

This is a 12-week beginner workout routine designed to introduce you to various gym equipment and basic bodybuilding exercises. The program runs for 3 days per week, with each workout lasting approximately 30-45 minutes. The main goal is to build muscle. The first six weeks focus on a total body circuit, progressing from 1 set of 15 reps to 2 sets of 12 reps with increased weight. The final six weeks transition to an upper/lower split, performed on non-consecutive days, with a focus on increased intensity and slightly lower rep ranges for most exercises.","### Weeks 1-3: Total Body Circuit Workout

### Overview

This plan provides three distinct 15-minute warm-up routines: a Full-Body Focus, a Lower Body Focus, and an Upper Body Focus. Each routine is designed to be performed for 1 set per exercise, with most exercises followed by a 30-45 second rest period (unless otherwise noted). The overall goal is general fitness, preparing the body for any subsequent workout program by maximizing readiness in a versatile and quick manner.

### Cardio

HIIT cardio can be performed 3-4 times a week or as you see fit based on your individual goals. If possible, perform your cardio separately from weight training. If you must do it when training, do it post-weight training when glycogen storages are depleted.

**20 Mins HIIT Protocol:**
*   2 minute warm-up
*   30 seconds all-out effort followed by 90 seconds low-moderate effort.
*   Repeat for a total of 8 rounds.
*   2 minute cool down.

### Overview

This is an advanced, 8-week ""Spring Shred"" program designed for fat loss, with a total of 5 training days per week. The split focuses on specific muscle groups each day: Chest & Abs, Back, Shoulders, Arms, and Legs. Each workout is estimated to take 45-60 minutes and incorporates various intensity methods such as forced reps, drop sets, rest-pause, and supersets to maximize muscle engagement and calorie expenditure. The plan also includes a structured HIIT cardio protocol to be performed 3-4 times per week, ideally separate from weight training sessions.","### Day 1: Chest & Abs

### Overview

This is a 3-day per week Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) split designed for muscle building using only resistance bands. Each workout focuses on hitting a specific muscle group (Push, Pull, or Legs) with exercises performed for as many reps as possible (AMRAP) while leaving 0-2 reps in reserve (RIR), emphasizing metabolic stress training. The workouts are efficient, typically lasting 30-45 minutes, making them suitable for home training with minimal equipment.","### Day 1: Push

**Overview:**
This is ""The Booty Burner"" workout, a dedicated glute-focused routine designed by Courtney King and Team Muscle & Strength. It is structured as a single workout session, intended to be performed 1-2 times per week, making it a 1-day per week split (or 2-day if repeated). The primary focus is to build muscle and strengthen the glutes, heavily utilizing supersets to maximize efficiency and minimize rest between exercises within a set. This intermediate-level program is designed to last 8 weeks, with each session taking approximately 45-60 minutes and requiring a variety of equipment including bodyweight, cables, dumbbells, and machines.","### The Booty Burner Workout

### Overview

This ""Wheels Workout"" is an 8-week program designed to build muscle, specifically focusing on leg development. Despite the source stating ""1 Day Per Week,"" the plan clearly outlines two distinct leg-focused training days: one emphasizing hamstrings and the other quadriceps. This suggests a 2-day per week split dedicated to legs. Each workout is estimated to take 45-60 minutes and is suitable for beginners, utilizing a variety of equipment including bands, barbells, dumbbells, and machines.","### Leg Day 1: Hamstring Emphasis

For the remaining exercises, use moderate weights and avoid training to failure.
This optional day is designed to improve unilateral strength through single-leg exercises. Add it if 
you want to dedicate extra time to lower body development. Training one leg at a time helps
correct muscle imbalances, improves stability, and can enhance overall athletic performance.This workout targets the rest of your upper body. Use challenging, but manageable, weights. You 
should leave feeling worked, not drained.","Here is the reorganized workout plan:

## Overview

This is an 8-week strength building program designed for beginners, focusing on increasing overall strength. The program is structured across 5 training days per week, with each day dedicated to a primary compound lift (Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Standing Barbell Press, and Bent-Over Barbell Row). The main lifts follow a progressive overload scheme based on percentages of a tested max, with two ""Max Out"" weeks (Week 1 and Week 8) for baseline testing and retesting. Accessory exercises are included each day to complement the main lift and target supporting muscle groups.","### Monday - Squat
